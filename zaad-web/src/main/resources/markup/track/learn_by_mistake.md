We can learn from mistakes
[desc]
When we learn new thing whether it's language or not, we all have a tendency to do it as before.

Especially when we are old, we'd like to follow out inertia. 
Because It's not easy to break out bad habit, 
we tend to make many mistakes when we come across unfamiliar concepts.

There is no exception in English learning. 

As we learn new grammars, vocabularies or phrases, we have an aptitude to make many mistakes.
Without mistakes, there is no progress. 

Let's learn through mistakes!!!
