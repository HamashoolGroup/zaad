Killing two birds with one stone. That stone is news!!!
[desc]
Any native kid can speak English fluently, but they can't communicate with adult about politics, economy, etc. 
It's not because they couldn't listen, but they couldn't understand the topics.

The same rule applies to us, English learners.
If we aren't familiar with topics, we can't understand conversations. Even worse, it's not likely to catch words at all!!!

In this case, English news is a good solution for getting knowledge as well as improving listening skills.
