Hence We all have drawbacks, have Confidence  in yourself

Are you preparing for job interview with global company in English? 
Giving a good impression on a first meeting is very important and the job interview is the first and maybe the last chance you have.

However it's stressful in that you have to answer to introspective questions like:
Tell me about yourself
What are your strengths?
Why did you leave your last company?

In addition to giving a impressive and honest answer, you should show self-confidence. 
Even though you don't have perfect opinion about the question, you don't need to be easily cowed. 
Answering right is more important than giving a right answer.

Believe in yourself!
