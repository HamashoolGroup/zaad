Speak naturally and fluently with reductions in English
[desc]
As English learners, we tend to speak each word clearly and distinctly. 
As a result of this, the pronunciations we use are rather awkward to understand. 

Additionally, the speed of speech is rather slow. 

Even worse it affects on our comprehension because we don't speak as we speak.

The principal part of these differences between us and native speakers came from reductions.
Native speakers never speak each word clearly, but speak more smoothly.

Let's dive into natural and fluent world of English!
