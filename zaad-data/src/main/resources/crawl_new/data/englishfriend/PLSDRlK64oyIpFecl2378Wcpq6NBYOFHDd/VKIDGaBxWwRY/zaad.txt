Seductive Cave
Published on May 20, 2015
http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Going in the cave, then out, then in again... Seductive cave I'd briefly thought That we were done. It had seemed An amicable separation. Over so many years You mouldered me: I had to get out... Your dank depths And batty corners Caverns of misery. For at least a month I was free of you, And it would seem All the evidence suggested Total annihilation of The poisonous foundations Upon which our lives centred. Uprooted: An ugly twisted clump. In that place - Bold, green shoots up jump. Oh, seductive cave that was then! Those roots of yours go deeper still Not one for letting go I hear your words echo: 'This is our cave And it was built for two. A place for me and only you. To think you could stray So far from home, AND LEAVE ME HERE ALL ALONE!' And so I am back. Again. Your clammy walls engulfing me. And everyday that passes Less light, less cheer: And that greasy hold of yours Grows cold. - By Jade Joddle 2015 --------------------- What kind of introvert are you?
