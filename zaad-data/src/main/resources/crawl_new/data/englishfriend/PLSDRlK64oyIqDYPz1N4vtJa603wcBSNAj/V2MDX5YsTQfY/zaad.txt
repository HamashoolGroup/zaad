INTROVERT! INTROVERT! INTROVERT!
Published on Mar 4, 2015
What kind of introvert are you? Take the test: http://jadejoddle.com/take-the-test/ I look out at the world through big, googly introverted glasses. That's just how it is for me - so be it. I'm not proud about my introverted reality because I didn't do anything special to make it happen. For as long as I can remember, I've always been this way. The best times in my introverted life are when I escape into nature. I feel so connected and at peace to be off in the mountains exploring. Nature truly does restore a wearied introvert! Friends, I think it's high time we looked at the bigger picture of what it means to be an introvert and if you are ready I want you to hear me out. There are downsides too, you know. It's not all hipster glasses and bookstores. When something bad happens you might be like me and go running to your cave. I did this everytime something went wrong until one day I realised hiding away all alone makes an emotional crisis even worse. Another beef I have with my introversion is the shield I sometimes put up in social situations. I learnt how to put up this shield early in life and even now it happens on autopilot if I'm not paying attention. This shield is very handy to keep people at arm's length when you don't want to be disturbed by a random, but when you're open to having a quick chat with a stranger for the sake of human-to-human connection, it's an awkward handicap and keeps people away. I feel like I've been an introvert for a million years. I know this life so well now that my only growing space is whatever lies beyond my cave. I have a candle and matches, if we unite, we can find our way out of here together... --- What kind of introvert are you? Take the test: http://jadejoddle.com/take-the-test/
