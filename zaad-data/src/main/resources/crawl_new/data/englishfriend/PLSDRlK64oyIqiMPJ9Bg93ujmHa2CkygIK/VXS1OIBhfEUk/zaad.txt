How to improve your voice

http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-... How to improve your voice by developing resonance training exercises for your best speaking voice or signing voice. Few people have achieved their best voice. We don't speak with rich, warm and deep voices as standard. That's because we're battling huge emotional blocks in our minds and in our bodies that stop us from communicating expressively and fully. By working to develop the resonance of your speech, you will be breaking up some of the physical blocks in your body on your way to achieving your best speaking voice. When developing resonance, think of your body as being like a speaker or amp. If you don't use your speaker correctly, you will not be able to speak loudly without training your voice. For people who currently resonate in their nose area, you can learn to push your resonance down by doing the resonance training exercises in the video. By practising these exercises over time, you will be able to talk loudly without shouting like a stage actor. 1 Massage your body and sides as you hmm / ohm. Don't forget to breathe! 2 Practise resonating at the tip of your head in a high pitch and then bring it down low into the diaphram. It helps if you move your hand as you do it. You can then change direction as you hmm from low to high. 3. Visualise the sound of your voice travelling all around you as you hmm and resonate. ------- Learn a British Accent FAST: http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-...
