Body Language Conversation
Published on Sep 17, 2014
http://jadejoddle.com/join/ We are communicating at the level of body language all the time - get it right with conversation coach Benjamin's advice. Learn English with Jade Joddle: http://jadejoddle.com/learn-english-g... The Handshake When meeting someone you don't know very well or when two men are meeting Benjamin advises shaking hands. A good handshake is firm and doesn't have too many wiggles. Body Posture in Interaction We also need to pay attention to the angle of our bodies while we are communicating with others. The best body posture to use depends on how well you know someone and the situation you are in. As a general rule, it is intimidating to stand very close while making full eye contact. As Benjamin says, looking at someone straight on can have the 'teacher and pupil' effect, which isn't good for open and relaxed conversation. Closed Body Language Crossing arms or legs is a comfortable body posture for many people yet they may not realise that it gives off an unfriendly 'barrier message' to other people. Fiddling When having a conversation it can be distracting to play with your hair or jewellery and may seem as if you are not interested. Eye Contact To avoid eye contact will suggest that you lack confidence. Eye contact is important, however, if you're thinking about it too much it may be unnatural - relax and occasionally glance at the other person. --------- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below?
