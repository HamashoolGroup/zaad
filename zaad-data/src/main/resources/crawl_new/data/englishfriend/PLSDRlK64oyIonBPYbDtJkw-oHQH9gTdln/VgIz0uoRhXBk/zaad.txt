http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Tips for speaking with confidence from conversation skills expert Benjamin. According to conversation skills expert Benjamin, confidence is a state of being. For us to be able to access a confident state, we need to make sure that we have all the basics in place. This means that we should make an effort with our appearance and wear clothes in which we feel confident. To be confident in conversation we should also seek to hold a positive mindset in our interactions. This means making an effort to focus on what is good in our lives and sharing that with others as part of conversation. When a person has a negative mindset and looks for the worst in everything all the time, it is draining for other people who may not know what to say to the negative person. To hold a positive mindset in conversation, it's good to talk about the activities you have been doing recently. By talking about the things you have been doing and not your feelings, you may be able to maintain a more positive mindset. To speak with confidence, it's also essential to pay attention to your tone of voice. Seek to bring as much energy as possible to your voice as it will make what you are saying much more interesting and engaging to the people to whom you are speaking.
