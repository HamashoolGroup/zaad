Check out Benjamin's EngVid Channel: https://www.youtube.com/EnglishBenjamin Check out Benjamin's second channel Exquisite English: https://www.youtube.com/ExquisiteEnglish To be dynamic and charismatic we need voices that project we are engaged with life and that we communicate our desires to people. This means that we have energy and also a full range of expression in the voice. Benjamin's dynamic voice training exercise shows you how you can bring passion to your voice like a Shakespearean?actor. Benjamin recommends using famous lines from Shakespeare because the characters are in extreme situations. This means that we can be dramatic and passionate when performing the lines. In his exercise we see how the same line can be read in a number of ways to show different feelings. With Benjamin's instruction, I am shown how to bring dynamism to the line in different ways through experiment with tone of voice. We should then bring this dynamism to our everyday speech to make a dynamic impression. More voice Training: http://jadejoddle.com/voice-training-... -- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below?
