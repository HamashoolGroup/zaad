Check out Benjamin's EngVid Channel: https://www.youtube.com/EnglishBenjamin Check out Benjamin's second channel Exquisite English: https://www.youtube.com/ExquisiteEnglish To set free your inner voice try this voice training exercise from the Method School of Acting, which would have been practised by actors like Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino. The idea of this exercise is to develop a voice that is deeply grounded in the body, carrying with it a deep, powerful resonance. A grounded voice voice is rich and deep - that's very different to a voice that resonates in the head, which is like a nerd voice. Let Your Inner Voice Out - Voice Exercise: 1) Sit in a chair and lean back so that your neck hangs at the back over the chair. 2) Roll your neck, shoulders, waist and circle your legs. 3) As you make the circlular undulating movements say 'ahhh' with your voice as deep down in your body as you can. 4) Whenever you feel the energy build up and you want to release say 'ha!' You should continue the exercise for around 15 minutes. The exercise will deeply relax you therefore it is good to energize yourself after with some body patting up and down your legs, waist and arms.
