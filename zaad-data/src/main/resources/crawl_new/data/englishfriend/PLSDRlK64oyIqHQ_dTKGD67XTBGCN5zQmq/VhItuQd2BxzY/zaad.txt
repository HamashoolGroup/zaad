Take the test: http://jadejoddle.com/take-the-test/ Living in the grey zone is what it means to live your life within a narrow range of emotional experience. You are not able to feel the full range of feelings, good or bad, and the feelings that are felt are muted and less intense. I spent most of my life living in the grey zone. I was not able to feel excitement nor able to feel really happy about anything. Instead I exerienced life somewhere in the dull middle-ground where I was safe from experiencing extremes of emotion. Although I was safe, it felt wrong not being able to get excited or enthusiastic about anything. Climbing up into our heads and cutting off from feeling the emotions happens as a strategy to protect ourselves. At some point we (unconsciously) decide that we don't want to feel emotions because it is simply too painful. Over time we then forget how to access the more extreme emotions. We simply stuff them down very deeply and hope that they go away. My journey to emerge from the grey zone of emotional numbness involved me learning to express myself on camera. At first I was monotone and flat when speaking / performing to the camera, however, I got better as I kept practising. I found that by remembering how to access my hidden emotions in front of the camera, I was able to remember these same emotions in my daily life when I wasn't performing. For me, improvised speaking performance such as I am doing in this video, allows me to get in touch with my emotions and to become steadily more expressive overall.
