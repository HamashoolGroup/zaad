http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-... Accent training lesson to practise English pronunciation. In this video get accent training to make the /p/ and /b/ sounds in English. A lot of people have a problem making a clear distinction between these two sounds. This often happens because you do not have both of these sounds in your native language - as is the case in Arabic. The difference between the two sounds is simpler than it seems at first. The difference is that the /p/ sound is aspirated which means as we say it we release a puff of air. The /b/ sound is made with the same tongue and mouth position although we don't release air at the same time. Apply the accent training exercises in the video consistently and over time you will be able to make a clear distinction between these two commonly mispronounced sounds.
