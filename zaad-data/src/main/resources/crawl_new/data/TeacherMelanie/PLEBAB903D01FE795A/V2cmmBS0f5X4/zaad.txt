http://www.englishteachermelanie.com L and R - Part 1: How to make the L & R sounds http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv84Gu... Hi, everyone! I'm Melanie! In this pronunciation practice video, we'll do some exercises to practice the L and R consonant sounds at the beginning of a word or syllable. Get your mirror ready, so you can make sure that your mouth is doing the same thing as my mouth. If you need to review how to make these sounds, watch this video first [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv84Gu...]. Let's get started! That's it! If you still have trouble hearing the difference between L & R, watch this video again. Watch it as many times as necessary for you to hear the difference ... and remember: practice these sounds for AT LEAST 15 minutes every day! Good luck, and I'll see you in the next video. I'm Melanie, from EnglishTeacherMelanie.com. Bye, everyone!
