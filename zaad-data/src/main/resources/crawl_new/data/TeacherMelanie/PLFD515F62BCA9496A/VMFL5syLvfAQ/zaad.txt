30 French Words Used in English! - (ESL) American Pronunciation Lesson
Uploaded on Oct 24, 2011
http://www.englishteachermelanie.com *A note about the IPA symbols used in the video: there is no way to make the small capital 'I' symbol (like in the 'e?' sound in 'ballet') with the software I use to make my videos. I decided to use the large capital 'I' in place of it. Have you noticed that some English words don't quite sound English? Have you noticed some English words with accents? That's because we stole some French words and made them English words! Obviously, the pronunciation has changed. With some of these words, the definition is different as well.
