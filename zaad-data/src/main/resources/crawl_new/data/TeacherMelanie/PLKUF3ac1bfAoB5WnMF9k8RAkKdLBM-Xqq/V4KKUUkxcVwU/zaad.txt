How to say "How are you?" like a native speaker!
Published on Dec 1, 2015
http://www.englishteachermelanie.com Listen & repeat. Hear the sounds, and repeat the sounds that you hear. Don?t try to see the letters & pronounce the letters. I am always trying to think of new ways to help you improve your English and sound more like a native speaker! The best way to improve your pronunciation is to imitate the sounds you hear, so I came up with the idea of the "English Sentence of the Day" - one video a day, every day for the entire month of December. In each video, I say one English sentence naturally, as if I was talking to my family and my friends. This will help you learn to understand natural spoken English, and it will help you sound like a native speaker.
