How to say "Thank you," "You're welcome," & "No problem" like a native speaker!
Published on Dec 6, 2015
http://www.englishteachermelanie.com/ In school you?re taught to say ?You?re welcome,? but in the real world, a native speaker will probably say ?No problem? instead of ?You?re welcome.? In natural spoken English, you?ll also hear two different ways to say ?No problem." This is your English sentence of the day. Have you ever wanted to speak English like an American*? Learn how to understand natural spoken English AND learn how to sound more like a native speaker. (*Yeah, I?m Canadian, but we sound the same.) Every day I upload a new sentence for you to practice. Listen & repeat. Hear the sounds, and repeat the sounds that you hear. Don?t try to see the letters & pronounce the letters.
