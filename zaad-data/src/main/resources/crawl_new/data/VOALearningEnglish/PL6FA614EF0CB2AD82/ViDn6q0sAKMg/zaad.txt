'Think and Grow Rich,' in a Comic Book for a New Generation
Published on Nov 16, 2012
From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report in Special English. Can you think your way to wealth and success? Napoleon Hill believed that if you think the right thoughts you can. In 1937, he published the book "Think and Grow Rich." Napoleon Hill spent many years researching financial success and observing people who had become rich. Although it was published in the middle of The Great Depression, it was an immediate success. "Think and Grow Rich" remains one of the most-popular non-fiction books ever written. Forbes magazine says it has sold 70 million copies since it first appeared, and continues to sell today. Napoleon Hill wrote at least ten other books about success before his death in 1970. None of Hill's books came close to selling as many copies as "Think and Grow Rich." But for today's generation, "Think and Grow Rich" is now available in a different form. SmarterComics has released an illustrated version of the book. Franco Arda is the company's founder and publisher. He used to work as an investment banker. He started the company three years ago with his own money. He wanted to create picture books that increase understanding. His versions provide much of the information that is in full-length books but in an easy-to-understand, picture, or comic, form. Franco Arda says readers will understand and remember more about gaining success if they read the comic book version of "Think and Grow Rich." He says pictures make the book easier to remember.He says the book taught him to change the way he thinks about money and success. SmarterComics says the book tells how "wealth is a lifelong pursuit achieved by believing in the value of personal ideas." It says anyone can achieve their dreams by refusing to be stopped by temporary problems. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal. (Adapted from a radio program broadcast 26Oct2012)
