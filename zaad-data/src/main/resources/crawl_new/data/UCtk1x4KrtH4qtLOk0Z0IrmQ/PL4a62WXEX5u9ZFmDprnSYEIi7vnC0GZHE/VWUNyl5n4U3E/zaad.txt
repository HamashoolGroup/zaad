Published on Mar 20, 2015
In this video blog, Amy talks about her method of finding new vocabulary from everyday conversations. Having a transcription of the audio is very useful to look at grammar and find new words. Understanding more from words by understanding to topic or anticipating what will be said next. All the conversations from Real English Conversations have a transcription available to our Premium Members. Check out this video to see the features for our lifetime premium members: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4elmF...

The Real English Conversations channel on You Tube, our website and our blog have been inspired by our own adventure to learn a second language. They have been created for anyone who is looking to listen to intermediate English audio or Advanced English Audio from a native speaker with an American English accent. All of our conversations are completely unscripted. Your hosts, Amy & Curtis, are from Canada but the Canadian accent and Canadian English is comparable to anyone from the United States from the west coast or the central United States. We want you to hear the natural flow of an English conversation and recognize the differences between written English and real spoken English. All of our real English conversations include a transcription that is available on our website at http://www.realenglishconversations.net/ We realized that most learning resources are BORING which usually leads to loosing motivation to continue to learn English. One of the most effective ways to learn and improve listening comprehension, learn new vocabulary and learn how to use natural English expressions is by listening to interesting dialogues from native speakers. The type of conversation you want to listen to over and over again. Our goal in every audio recording, every blog post and everything on our website is to make learning English fun for you!
