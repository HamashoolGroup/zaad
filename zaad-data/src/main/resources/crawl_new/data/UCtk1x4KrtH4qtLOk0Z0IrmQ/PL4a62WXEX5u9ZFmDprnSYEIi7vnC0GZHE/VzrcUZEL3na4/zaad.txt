30 Day Speaking Challenge | Video Blog | Real English Conversations |

In this video, we talk about the challenge we are about to start, some of our concerns and why we have decided to do it. Curtis and I have decided that we want to try a new strategy to develop our abilities to speak more comfortably and confidently in the language we are trying to learn. About a year ago, we read a recommendation from Benny Lewis (a famous polyglot) that suggested you force yourself to communicate only in the language you want to learn for 3 months. Of course, this is easier if you are living in a country that speaks the language but it is not impossible to create a similar environment within your home if you have a spouse or a room-mate that is willing to participate.
