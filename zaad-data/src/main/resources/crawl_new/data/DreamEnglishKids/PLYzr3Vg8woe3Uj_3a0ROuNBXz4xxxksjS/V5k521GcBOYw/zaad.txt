ABC Song for Kids: Easy and Fun Version
Uploaded on Aug 17, 2009
About this ABC Song: This version has a slow L,M,N,O,P as it was originally recorded to teach children learning English as a second or foreign language. I found it much easier for the children to recognize and memorize all of the letters this way. It has since caught on around the world.
