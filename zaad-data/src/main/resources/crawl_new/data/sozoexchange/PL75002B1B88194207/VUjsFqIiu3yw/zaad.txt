http://sozoexchange.com/quizzes/ Can you tell the difference?- Live & Leave Today, we are going to learn about the difference in American pronunciation between the words "live" and "leave". These words may sound very much alike but they are pronounced a little differently. The first word "live" is a verb which means to be alive. The second word "leave" is a verb which means to go away from something or someone. The difference between the two words lies in their vowel sounds. The word "live" has this short vowel sound "?" after the "L" sound like "l?" while "leave" has this long vowel sound "i?" like "Li?". The key is to pull your lips back when you say "leave." Let me demonstrate how to pronounce these words.
