We look at some useful phrases for posting things and asking about times and prices. BBC Learning English has produced a short course called Learning Circles for UK learners of English who have little or no English. The target audience is Bangla, Urdu and Somali speakers. The materials are all in English so anyone can use the content. Learning Circles has been designed as a free resource for anyone to use in the local community to help others learn English. For more information on Learning Circles: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/... Learning Circles is part of a broader project, called English My Way. This project has been funded by the Department for local government and communities. English My Way provides a 24 week teacher-led course for the same target group.
