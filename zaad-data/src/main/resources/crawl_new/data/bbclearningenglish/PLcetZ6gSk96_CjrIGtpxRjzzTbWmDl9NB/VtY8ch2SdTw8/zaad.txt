BBC English Class: Have something done: The causative
Published on Mar 16, 2016
Some people are multi-talented. They can do just about anything they put their mind to. But everyone needs some help at some point. Could you repair your own car? Could you fix your washing machine? Could you mend your favourite bag? If you couldn't or if you don't want to do these things yourself, you need to get someone to do them for you. Grammatically we use a form called the causative to talk about this. Dan tells us all about it in the video. Find out more here http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/...
