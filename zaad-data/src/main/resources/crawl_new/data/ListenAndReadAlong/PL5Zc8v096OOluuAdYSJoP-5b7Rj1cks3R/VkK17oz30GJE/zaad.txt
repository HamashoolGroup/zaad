The religious leader surprised Roman Catholic officials when he announced his resignation at the Vatican on Monday. He said he was no longer strong enough to carry out his duties as head of the world's largest Christian group. The 85-year-old pope told Vatican officials that his health had worsened in recent months. He said he had to recognize what he called his "incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted" to him. On Tuesday, the Vatican confirmed that Pope Benedict has had a pacemaker for years to help control his heartbeat. Pope Benedict spoke to people gathered in St. Peter's Square last Sunday. He talked about "peace, harmony and gratitude to Heaven." Few people knew that this would be one of the last times he would speak publicly as pope. Many people were shocked by the pope's resignation.

He grew up in Nazi, Germany when Adolf Hitler served as its ruler. His father was a police officer. Young Joseph joined the Hitler Youth organization in 1941 at a time when all German boys were required to do so. He said he left the group as World War Two was ending. Joseph studied at a Catholic seminary after the war. He became a clergyman in 1951. He taught theology at several universities from 1959 to 1966. In 1977, he became a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich. In 1981, Pope John-Paul II named Cardinal Ratzinger the head of the Vatican office that enforces church theology and rules -- the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
