AS IT IS - Libya - Writing a Constitution - 13 Feb 2013 And now to Libya where citizens are trying to write a new Constitution. The country is suffering delays in the writing process as it faces big decisions. Who should write the document How can it represent all the people including women. Kelly Jean Kelly tells about it. Libyans are frustrated by how slowly change is coming to their country. For example, they say the delay in writing a new Constitution is hurting the effort to persuade rebel militiamen to give up their weapons. One reason there has been no work on a new Constitution is the lack of agreement on how the members of the Constitution-writing committee should be chosen. Some say they should be elected. Others believe they should be named by the countrys new parliament, the General National Congress. Another reason for the delay is that politicians can't agree on how to ensure that Libyas three regions have the chance to influence what is in the Constitution. And some fear that women will not be represented. Parliamentarians from different political parties have formed a group to work on the issue. They want to ensure there are a fair number of female representatives on the Constitution writing committee. Activists are warning that the Constitution writing process should not be anything like the one used in Egypt. A rushed process there led to accusations of a lack of inclusiveness and caused violent protests. Diplomats and International legal experts say the process must last long enough for Libyans to have a chance to tell the committee what they believe should be in the Constitution.
