AS IT IS - Egypt - Police coercion - 19 Feb 2013 To many people, the violence that has seized Egypt since late last month has become a common event: Angry young men incited police officers, and the police reacted with extreme force. When the dead and wounded were counted, they included police officers, protesters and people not even involved in the violence. VOA's Christopher Cruise reports. One image in particular caught the attention of Egyptians. It was a video of a single protester, with his clothes pulled off, kicked and beaten by police. Forty-eight-year-old Hamada Saber had been protesting outside the presidential palace. "At first, after being taken into custody... " Hamada Saber said it was protesters who hurt him. The police, he said, had helped him. He spoke from a hospital bed. But after his release, he blamed police for the beating. His hospital statement brought to mind countless cases of police coercion, part of a larger system of injustice that helped set off Egypt's rebellion two years ago. Wael Khalil is a political activist and blogger. "This oppressive apparatus has not changed a bit, at all. I mean, it is working with the same rule book. It is still untouchable. No one is accountable." Egypt's interior minister has warned that without the police, the country could become a militia-state. The office of President Mohamed Morsi has promised an investigation. But how much influence Mr. Morsi has or is willing to use is unclear. Interior Ministry reform has been slow -- even to make a change as simple as expressing support for riot control over violent suppression. For many Egyptians, what is clear after seven months of Mr. Morsi's presidency, is that they want him to do more. AS IT IS is a VOA news Magazine and is in the Public Domain
