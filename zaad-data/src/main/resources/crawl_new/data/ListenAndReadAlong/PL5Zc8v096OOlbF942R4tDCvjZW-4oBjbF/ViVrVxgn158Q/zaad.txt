AS IT IS - 2 Feb 2013 - China Censuring of U.S. Movies China has become a huge market for films. It is second only to North America. China is also extending its entertainment work with other countries. And this is changing the way the American film industry does business. Steve Ember has a front row seat. A foreign army invaded the United States in last year's remake of the movie "Red Dawn." But the filmmakers changed the movie just before its release. The invaders had originally been Chinese soldiers. They became North Koreans. The "Red Dawn" filmmaker did not want to offend Chinese audiences or censors. A team of censors in China watches movies to decide if they contain offensive material. The James Bond movie "Skyfall" had parts removed for that reason. And, the censors cut 40 minutes from the recent film "Cloud Atlas." Most of the scenes showed sex and violence. But, films also may be cut if they are judged critical of China or its government. Stanley Rosen is a Chinese film and culture expert at the University of Southern California. He says Chinese censors also influenced other films, like the disaster story "2012." "Even if you're not shooting in China, a film like "2012" will be very careful to include positive references to China. Negative references will simply kill the market." Stanley Rosen says more Hollywood studios are finding Chinese partners for joint productions. Hollywood needs China because the North American market has not been strong, the professor believes. But, he says, China needs Hollywood as well. "All text, audio and video material produced exclusively by the Voice of America is public domain.
