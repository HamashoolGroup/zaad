Sing Out Loud Traditional Songs LYRICS: SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT (CHORUS) Swing low, sweet chariot. Comin' for to carry me home! Swing low, sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home! 1. I looked over Jordan an' what did I see, Comin' for to carry me home? A band of angels comin' after me, Comin' for to carry me home. Repeat Chorus: Swing low, sweet chariot. Comin' for to carry me home! Swing low, sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home! 2. If you get there before I do, Comin' for to carry me home, Tell all my friends I'm comin' too, Comin' for to carry me home. Repeat Chorus: Swing low, sweet chariot. Comin' for to carry me home! Swing low, sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home! 3. Sometime I'm up, sometimes I'm down, Comin' for to carry me home. But still my soul feels heavenly bound. Comin' for to carry me home. Repeat Chorus: Swing low, sweet chariot. Comin' for to carry me home! Swing low, sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home!
