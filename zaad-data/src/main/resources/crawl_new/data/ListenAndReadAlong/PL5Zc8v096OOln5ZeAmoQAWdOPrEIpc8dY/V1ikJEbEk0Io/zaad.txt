Songs - Traditional - On Top of Old Smokey
Published on Oct 14, 2013
ON TOP OF OLD SMOKEY On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow, I lost my true lover, come acourtin' too slow. For courtin's a pleasure, and parting is grief; a false hearted lover, is worse than a thief. For a thief he will rob you, and take what you have, but a false-hearted lover, will send you to your grave. She'll hug you and kiss you, and tell you more lies, than the crossties on a railroad, or stars in the skies. On top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow, I lost my true lover, come acourtin' too slow. Thanks to http://americanenglish.state.gov/reso...
