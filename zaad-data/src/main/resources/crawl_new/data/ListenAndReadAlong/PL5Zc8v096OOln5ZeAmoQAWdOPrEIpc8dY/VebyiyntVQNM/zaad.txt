Songs - Oh My Darlin' Clementine
Published on May 14, 2013
1. In a cavern in a canyon, Excavating for a mine, Lived a miner forty-niner, And his daughter Clementine. (CHORUS) Oh, my darlin', Oh my darlin', Oh my darlin' Clementine. You are lost and gone forever, Dreadful sorry Clementine. 2. Light she was and like a fairy, And her shoes were number nine: Herring boxes without topses, Sandals were for Clementine. Repeat Chorus: Oh, my darlin', Oh my darlin', Oh my darlin' Clementine. You are lost and gone forever, Dreadful sorry Clementine. 3. Drove she ducklings to the water, Every morning at nine. Stubbed her toe against a splinter; Fell into the foaming brine. Repeat Chorus: Oh, my darlin', Oh my darlin', Oh my darlin' Clementine. You are lost and gone forever, Dreadful sorry Clementine. 4. Ruby lips above the water Blowin' bubbles soft and fine. But, alas, I was no swimmer, SO U lost my Clementine. Repeat Chorus: Oh, my darlin', Oh my darlin', Oh my darlin' Clementine. You are lost and gone forever, Dreadful sorry Clementine. 5. How I missed her, how I missed her, How I missed my Clementine, Until I kissed her little sister, And forgot my Clementine! Repeat Chorus: Oh, my darlin', Oh my darlin', Oh my darlin' Clementine. You are lost and gone forever, Dreadful sorry Clementine. thanks to http://americanenglish.state.gov/reso...
