Songs - Hush Little Baby, Don't You Cry
Published on Feb 16, 2014
HUSH LITTLE BABY, DON'T YOU CRY Hush, little baby, don't you cry; Papa's going to sing you a lullaby. Hush little baby don't say a word; Papa's going to buy you a mockingbird. If that mockingbird won't sing, Papa's going to buy you a golden ring. If that gold ring turns to brass, Papa's going to buy you a looking glass. If that glass begins to crack, Papa's going to buy you a jumping jack. If that jumping jack is broke, Papa's going to buy you a velvet cloak. If that velvet cloth is coarse, Papa's going to buy you a rocking horse. If that rocking horse won't rock, Papa's going to buy you a cuckoo clock. If that cuckoo clock won't tick, Papa's going to buy you a walking stick. If that walking stick falls down, you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town!
