Published on Sep 17, 2013
Sing Out Loud Traditional Songs LYRICS: IVE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD 1. I've been working on the railroad. All the live long day. I've been working on the rail road, just to pass the time away. Can't you hear the whistle blowing? Rise up so early in the morn! Can't you hear the captain shouting? Dinah, blow your horn! Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow your horn? Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow your horn? Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, someone's in the kitchen, I know! Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, strumming on the old banjo. Fee fi fiddley aye, oh! Fee fi fiddley aye, oh- Fee fi fiddley aye, oh! Strumming the old ban-jo! Thanks to http://americanenglish.state.gov/reso...
