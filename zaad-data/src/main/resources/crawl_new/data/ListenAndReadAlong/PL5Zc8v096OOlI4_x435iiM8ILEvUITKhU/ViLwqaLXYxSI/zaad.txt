Being Disabled in America - Autistic Children - Entertainment Options
Published on Apr 9, 2013
03/25/2013 From VOA Learning English, welcome to THIS IS AMERICA in Special English. I'm Kelly Jean Kelly. And I'm Jim Tedder. Today we look at what's happening with employment, education and entertainment for people with disabilities. Imagination Stage is a children's theater in the state of Maryland. A special performance of each play is produced for children with autism. People with autism have difficulty communicating and socializing with other people. Children in the theater are allowed to move around during the performance. It's OK if they shout out or hold their ears when the music is too loud. These special performances are sometimes the only way a family can go to the theater together if a child has autism. That is the same idea with Autism on the Seas. This company organizes vacations for families of children with autism -- especially vacations on cruise ships. Jamie Grover is director of group development for Autism on the Seas. "The advantage that most of these families experience is having our staff on board that have the knowledge to work with their children and having the comfort factor knowing that they are going to be able to relax, enjoy their vacation, participate in ship activities knowing their children are well taken care of." Waiting in long lines or being in the middle of big crowds can cause problem behavior in children with autism. Autism on the Seas helps families avoid situations like that. Autism on the Seas works with the help of cruise companies like Royal Caribbean. Special times or places are arranged for families to play video games, go skating or rock climbing, or eat dinner. Autism on the Seas also directs families to organizations that can help them pay for these vacations. Bambi Van Woert from the state of Michigan went on a cruise with her 7-year-old, Ben, who has autism. "I would never do something like this myself. I cannot, I cannot take Ben grocery shopping by myself at this point, so for me to try to do a cruise for this long without experienced help is absurd." She says after the first few days, Ben became comfortable with the cruise and the experience was good for him.
