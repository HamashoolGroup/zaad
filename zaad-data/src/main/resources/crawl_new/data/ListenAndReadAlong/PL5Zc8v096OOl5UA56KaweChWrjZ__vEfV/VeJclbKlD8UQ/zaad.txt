Chapter Four Raggedy Ann and the Kite One day Marcella was playing with her friends. Raggedy Ann was with her. The children were making a kite. They used sticks and cloth to make the kite. They made a tail for the kite. And Then they tied a large ball of string to the kite. The kite was ready to fly now. One boy held the kite. A second boy held the string. There was a nice wind, and the kite needed wind to fly in the sky. The boy with the string said, "Let go." The other boy held the kite up in the air. Then he let the kite go. The boy with the string started to run. http://americanenglish.state.gov/reso... "All text, audio and video material produced exclusively by the US Department of State is public domain.
