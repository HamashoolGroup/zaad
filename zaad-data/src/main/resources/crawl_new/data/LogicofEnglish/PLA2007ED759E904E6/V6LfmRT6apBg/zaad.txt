Critical Thinking Skills for Reading, Spelling, and Literacy - Teacher In-Service Training
Published on Apr 7, 2014
Learn the vital role that critical thinking skills play in the development of strong reading skills, and introduce your staff to practical tips for reading, spelling, and language arts instruction that can be implemented in the classroom immediately after training! In "Critical Thinking Skills for Reading, Spelling, and Literacy," Denise Eide, author of "Uncovering the Logic of English," casts a vision for how to limit rote memorization and help students develop the critical thinking skills they need to build a deep and solid foundation for reading, writing, and all of education. In this short, free training, teachers will gain answers to questions that students ask every day about words. Discover tools that are empowering teachers across the nation to give real help to struggling readers, and become part of a movement to transform literacy instruction so that a majority of our nation's students read at grade level or above. Parents, tutors, and others will also benefit from this video as they develop a deeper understanding of how written English works. For more information, visit http://www.LogicOfEnglish.com.
