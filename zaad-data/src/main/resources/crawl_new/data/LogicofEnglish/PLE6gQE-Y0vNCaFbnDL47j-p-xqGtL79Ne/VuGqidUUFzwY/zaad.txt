Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Intro by Logic of English
Published on Sep 22, 2012
Here at The Logic of English we are passionate about changing how reading and spelling are taught. We desire to provide you access to the latest linguistics research, and to help you teach students critical thinking skills so they can become better language learners. This video series introduces the problem of English and the oversimplifications that have contributed to the widespread struggles with reading and spelling in our society today. It then moves to a discussion of learning styles, followed by the phonograms and spelling rules that explain 98% of English words, without exceptions. The material in these videos will help you understand how English works, debunking the myth that English is crazy and illogical. We have created a Teacher Training Manual that corresponds with this video series. The manual contains a detailed Table of Contents to help you navigate this material; notes that correspond to the presentation; games, activities, and ideas to implement this material in your classroom; and an appendix with phonograms, spelling rules, a sound-to-spelling reference chart, and a list of how words are marked in the Logic of English system. The Logic of English Teacher Training Manual may be purchased for $15 at: https://store.logicofenglish.com/prod... Join us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/#!/TheLogicOf...
