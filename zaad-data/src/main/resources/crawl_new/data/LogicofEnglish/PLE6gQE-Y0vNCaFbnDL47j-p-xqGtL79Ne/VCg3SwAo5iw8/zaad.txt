Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Section 7.3
Published on Sep 22, 2012
Phonograms and Spelling Rules Part 2, Continued: Accented Syllables and Schwa. In Section 7.3 Denise discusses the varying amounts of stress in English words and how it affects spelling. Many people have a hard time hearing which syllables are accented, so Denise teaches other strategies for finding the accent. Schwa is a distorted vowel sound in an unaccented syllable. The schwa sound is the most common sound in American and Commonwealth spoken English. It contributes greatly to the rhythm of our speech. Recognizing how schwa comes into play will help to clarify spelling and pronunciation of words. The Say to Spell technique, which Denise teaches in this video, will help you recall the spelling of unaccented vowels.
