Logic of English Foundations in action at Kaleidoscope Charter School
Published on Oct 31, 2013
Kaleidoscope Charter School in Otsego, Minnesota is piloting Logic of English's Foundations curriculum with all of their Kindergarten and 1st Grade students this year. We visited Kaleidoscope six weeks into the program to watch students learning with Foundations, hear from teachers about their experiences and the impact on their students' learning, and see how Logic of English is changing the way reading is taught in one school.
