Kids Learning to Read at Estill Elementary School
Published on Mar 3, 2015
This short documentary "Success, No Excuses" shows the commitment of the teachers and administration at Estill Elementary School to teach EVERY student in their school to read at grade level! Kids are getting excited about reading, confidence is skyrocketing, and students are becoming engaged in learning. This mini-documentary about the first four months of a joint project between Estill Elementary School, the South Carolina Literacy Task Force, and Logic of English will inspire others that it really is possible to teach every student to read! To support this project or learn more, visit the National Right to Read Foundation at http://www.nrrf.org/estill. Filmed on location in Estill, South Carolina.
