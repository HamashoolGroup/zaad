Critical thinking about language over rote memorization - Fluency - mastery in encoding and decoding to the point of automaticity - Reading Comprehension - Ideas for ways to meet requirements of SC legislation on Summer Reading Camps (Writing Workshop, Inquiry/Research, Reading Workshop) without discouraging or shaming struggling readers while building and strengthening their basic skills. - Multi-letter Phonograms - Teaching through discovery - Spelling Rules - Schwa - the lazy vowel - Depths of Learning - Elements of Effective Practice In this six-hour training, Logic of English author Denise Eide offers new and refreshing ways to foster student success, strengthen basic skills, increase children's enjoyment and confidence in reading, integrate critical thinking skills into language learning, and improve reading scores. This training, designed for teachers and administrators preparing for SC Summer Reading Camps, was recorded May 28, 2014 and sponsored by the United Way of the Midlands, the Augusta Baker Chair in Childhood Literacy at USC, the SC Literacy Task Force/SC Baptist Convention, Reach Out and Read, and Logic of English. While the video addresses some specific topics for SC Summer Reading Camps, most of the material will benefit any teachers, administrators, and homeschool parents who desire to help struggling readers, learn effective tools for teaching reading and spelling, and deepen their own understanding of how English works.
