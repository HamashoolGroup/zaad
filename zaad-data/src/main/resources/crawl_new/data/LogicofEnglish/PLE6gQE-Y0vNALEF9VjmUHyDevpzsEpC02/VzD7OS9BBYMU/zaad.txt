Crazy Words Explained 2
Published on Dec 14, 2012
Logic of English partnered with fourth grade students at Jefferson Elementary School to bring you: Crazy Words Explained! Each week students wrote words that appear to be exceptions to spelling rules, or words they simply did not understand in terms of why they are read and spelled in a particular manner. Students placed these words in a Crazy Words box, and Denise then selected five words from the box to explain on video. The words explained on this video are: horrendous, tongue, genius, quidditch, tsunami. To learn more about the Logic of English, visit http://www.LogicOfEnglish.com.
