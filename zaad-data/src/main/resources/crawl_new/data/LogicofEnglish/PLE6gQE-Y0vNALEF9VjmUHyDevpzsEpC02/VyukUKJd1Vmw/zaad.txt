Crazy Words Explained 1
Published on Jan 15, 2013
Logic of English partnerned with the fourth grade classes at Jefferson Elementary School to create a series of videos called "Crazy Words Explained." Each week students wrote words that appear to be exceptions to spelling rules, or words they simply did not understand in terms of why they are read and spelled in a particular manner. Students placed these words in a Crazy Words box, and Denise then selected five words from the box to explain on video.
