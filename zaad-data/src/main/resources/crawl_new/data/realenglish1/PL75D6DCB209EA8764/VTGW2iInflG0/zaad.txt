Uploaded on Jan 9, 2009
The lesson for THIS video begins here: http://www.real-english.com/reo/24/un... The Summary Page for ALL of our lessons is here: http://www.real-english.com/new-lesso... This video was made for The Electronic Village Online Group "Images4Education" a project of TESOL's CALL Interest Section, powered by webheads. The clip is 5 minutes long. I am submitting the first 3 and a half minutes of this clip as my introduction to the workshop - to show one way I often use images for ESL/EFL education. The last minute and a half is a personal message to fellow members. The first task in week 1 of this session is to upload a view - a photo normally - of the view from one's window. I uploaded a video of my view.
