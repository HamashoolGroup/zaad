Uploaded on Aug 20, 2009
Lesson for this video begins at http://www.real-english.com/walkscore... In this interview we meet two walkers who are enthusiastic about their walking lifestyle, but have never heard of Walk Score ?. There will be NO subtitles for this clip. Students can find the subtitles in the LESSONS for this clip on the Real English site. You must see the WalkScore videos on the Real English site with the Lessons. Then it all makes a lot of sense... for Americans.
