Real English? - What makes you happy? With Subtitles
Uploaded on Mar 16, 2011
Our Lessons are here: http://www.real-english.com/new-lesso... The question is "What makes you happy?". There are interesting answers, many of which reflect the fact that we are filming in Miami Beach, Florida, USA, and the last person in this video replies "sex and food". So, ESL/EFL TEACHERS BEWARE! Some teachers, like myself for example, will have a red face if a student asks me "What is sex?"
