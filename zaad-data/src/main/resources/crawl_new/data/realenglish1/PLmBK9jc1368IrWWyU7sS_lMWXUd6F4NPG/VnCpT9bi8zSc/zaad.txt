Real English? Subtitled - 84 - Second Language Series # 4
Uploaded on Feb 2, 2008
All the Real English LESSONS begin here: http://www.real-english.com/ There are 3 separate interviews in this clip. Instead of concentrating on the "How" of learning a Second Language, these people question the "Why", in the Spanish-speaking environment of south Florida. This is the version with subtitles. The same video WITHOUT subtitles is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uMeMC... Level: Upper Intermediate Students of English: To improve your pronunciation, watch the version WITHOUT subtitles before reading the subtitled versions! Listen several times before reading.
