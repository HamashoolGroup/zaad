The major force behind this video was my personal loss and the mention at the end of it in regard to the young Brazilian students who died coincided with the day of the video's release. This does not by any means make light of the fact that so many people have died or are dying all over the world. I was shocked as everybody to hear about all of the young people who lost their lives today in Santa Maria, Brazil. When I saw the tragedy on the news and the pain of the families, it hit me hard and very close to home. Seeing mothers and fathers anxiously waiting to find out if their son or daughter was on the list of those who had died was simply heartbreaking. I want to do my part here and share with you all a video on how to cope with losing someone. My lesson has great words of comfort and ways you can give your condolences in English. My heart goes out to all of these families and may they find the strength to get through such a difficult time Steve
