leave your question:http://privateenglishportal.com/welco... Hello! Hello! Hello my English students! Welcome to my most recent English learning video. I am very excited to be able to answer some Peppy Club member questions. Many of these questions come from people who have studied English for a while and are in need of filling in gaps with the English they already know. I've got these questions a lot both online and when I used to teach in the classroom and I am happy to put things to you in a way which hopefully will make learning grammar more exciting. At the beginning of my career as an English teacher over twenty years ago, I used to find grammar really boring. Everything seemed so methodical and bookish. I never dreamed at that time that we would have all of this technology so that I could make something more colorful and vibrant for everyone across the world.
