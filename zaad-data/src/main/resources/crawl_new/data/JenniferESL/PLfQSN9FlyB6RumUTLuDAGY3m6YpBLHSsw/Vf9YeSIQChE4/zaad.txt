For your convenience, here is the text you can copy and paste into a Word document. I'll sit and write a letter, Though writing's not my art. I'll have so much to tell you Once college makes us part. My words will be quite simple, But you'll still understand -- Our love is so strong and true, A treasure in my hand. I'll write and send a letter Since you'll be far away In that city, in that land -- I'll reach you in this way.
