How to answer behavioral interview questions - team failure sample answer
Published on Mar 13, 2012
Thank you for watching and best of luck with your interviews! My behavioral interview tips are here ? http://www.vinceprep.com/interviews/b... Often, interviewers ask a behavioral question without any guidance. The interviewer asks her question. Then, the interviewee mumbles out a long and boring response that fails to address the questions behind the question -- what the interviewer really wanted to hear but did not ask you to tell her. If interviewers explained the process, interviewees might feel comfortable having a discussion rather than presenting a memorized speech. Therefore, I suggest you imagine your interviewer saying something like this: "I'm going to ask you a behavioral question. As a part of your answer, please tell me about yourself. Your motivations. Your intentions. Your personal qualities. In your answer, be sure to cover the situation, the task, your action steps, and the results. If possible, I would also like to hear what you learned from experience and how you've applied that lesson. Here is the question: Tell me about a time you managed a team that failed." Possible follow up questions: How did that work out for you? What happened next? How did you feel about that? What did you do with that feeling? What did you say, and to whom, and why? How did s/he respond? What were you hoping or expecting s/he would say? What critical information did you lack to make your decision? How did you compensate for that lack of information?
