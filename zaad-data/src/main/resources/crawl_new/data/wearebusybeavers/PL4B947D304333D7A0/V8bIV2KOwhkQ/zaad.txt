This is great tune for Elementary School Kids to learn about Puffins. Any Teachers out there who want to use this video for a lesson about Puffins of the North Atlantic - you have my permission to use this Vid! Lyrics: The Puffin Song - by Dave Martin (Busy Beavers) Puffin Island is in Elliston And Elliston's in Newfoundland And Newfounland's in Canada You can see the Puffin there Now the Puffin is a cute little guy He can walk, he can run, he can swim, he can fly He's kind of friendly but mostly shy The Puffin of Newfoundland His beak is orange just like a carrot A little bit Penguin a little bit Parrot In Elliston you'll see him there It's the Puffin of Newfoundland He's black and white with great eyesight Can eat a fish in one big bite A powerful swimmer and swift in flight The Puffin of Newfoundland The north Atlantic is his home But wintertime down south he'll roam Then every summer he'll come home The Puffin of Newfoundland Now if you'd like a holiday With family and friends and games to play And arts and crafts and swimming all day Then I'd say Newfoundland The people you'll meet are kind and sweet There are moose and whales and berries to eat And best of all you'll get to see The Puffin of Newfoundland Busy Beavers iPhone App: http://tinyurl.com/44doo3h Website: http://BusyBeavers.com - Kids English Learning Resources - MP3s, Worksheets, Flash Cards, Games and more!
