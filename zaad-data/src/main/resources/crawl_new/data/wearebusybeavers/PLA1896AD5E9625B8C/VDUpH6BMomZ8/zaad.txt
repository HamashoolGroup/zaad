This funny song teaches places in the neighborhood with a funny joke in the chorus. Students who already know "The House Song" will recognize the phrases and melody. It's good for helping students ask and answer "Where is he/she?" and "What is he/she doing?" in full sentences. Plus it teaches a lot of new vocabulary. You can buy this video on a CD or DVD from our website shop, or in the Busy Beavers App "Jukebox"!
