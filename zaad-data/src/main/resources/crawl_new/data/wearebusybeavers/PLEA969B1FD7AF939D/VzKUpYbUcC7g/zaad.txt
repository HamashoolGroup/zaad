Website: http://BusyBeavers.com - Kids English Learning Resources - MP3s, Worksheets, Flash Cards, Games and more! The purpose of this activity is to teach students to get into the habit of saying "an" before words that begin with a vowel. This is a difficult habit for beginner students to get into and they will want to say "a" because of the repetition and practice they have already had.
