Speaking a Foreign Language is a "Brain Exercise" that benefits all other areas of Study such as Math, Music, Art & Science. Children under the age of 5 years old can learn a new language much more quickly than teens or adults. That is why it is important to introduce Foreign Languages to Kids at a very young age.
