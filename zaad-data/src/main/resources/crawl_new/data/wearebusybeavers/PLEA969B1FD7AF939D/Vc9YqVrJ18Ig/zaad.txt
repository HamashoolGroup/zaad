Website: http://BusyBeavers.com - Kids English Learning Resources - MP3s, Worksheets, Flash Cards, Games and more! This video is the first in a series of 7 tests at the end of Level 1. It reviews the names of the characters, things in the bedroom and some of the verbs taught in Level 1 of the Busy Beavers Series. Many parents of children with Autism and learning disabilities have told us how the repetition of this series helped their child learn to communicate better. Try the other Tests to find out how much your students have learned! You can buy this video on a DVD from our online shop.
