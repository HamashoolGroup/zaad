Uploaded on Nov 7, 2008
Website: http://BusyBeavers.com - Kids English Learning Resources - MP3s, Worksheets, Flash Cards, Games and more! Learn the names of the Busy Beaver characters, plus, learn how to ask the questions "What's his/her name?" One of the main concepts that this video teaches, and many ESL books neglect to teach, is to add the prefix Mr. to a man's name and Mrs. to a woman's name. Our song video "Characters (Song)" is a companion piece to this lesson. Try it out too! You can buy this video on a DVD from our online shop.
