Have students follow the Betty Beaver's actions and chant along with the other Characters. The "Simon Says" Song is a companion to this video so watch it often and have the kids learn the words and sing along - http://youtu.be/MLXZV456Or0 Try warming up with the "Parts of the Body" video first: http://youtu.be/I459vJiPgRs When kids have mastered this exercise move on to the next video "Touch Your Nose" - http://youtu.be/GIpzczraYL8
