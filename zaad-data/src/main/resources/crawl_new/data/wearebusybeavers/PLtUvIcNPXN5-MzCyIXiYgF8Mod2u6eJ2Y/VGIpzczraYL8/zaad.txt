Busy Beavers iPhone App: http://goo.gl/GWxz9 This is a great lesson for using TPR (Total Physical Response) in the classroom. Have students follow the actions of the characters in this video and tell you what they are touching. Try having your Students come up to the front of the Class and lead the group. One student can touch a part of his body and the other kids can tell you what he is touching. Try warming up with the "Parts of the Body" video: http://youtu.be/I459vJiPgRs Or "Touch Your Nose" - http://youtu.be/JdJ4VziqC8s Don't forget to play the "Simon Says" Song and have your students sing along - http://youtu.be/MLXZV456Or0
