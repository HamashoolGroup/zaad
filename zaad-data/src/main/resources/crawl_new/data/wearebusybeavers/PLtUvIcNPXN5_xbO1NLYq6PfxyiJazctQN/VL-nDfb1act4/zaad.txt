Busy Beavers Language Learning Videos follow a Basic Curriculum of Fundamental Vocabulary while slowly building Phrases & Sentences. Our videos take the same approach to Learning a New Language that a Baby takes in the real world. We listen and repeat until our brain solves the Language Puzzle. Imagine if you could play 5 Instruments - Piano, Guitar, Violin, Bass & Drums. How cool? What if that was with Languages? Think of the rich life you would live & all the possibilities of meeting New Friends Online or through Travel. Don't be afraid of trying to Learn a Foreign Language.
