Did you know that Children who play music also develop skills in other subjects more quickly than their non-musical classmates? This is the same for Children who can speak more than one language. Why do you think this is? Children under the age of 5 years old can develop Language and Music skills much faster than older children. That is why it is important to introduce Foreign Languages and Music to Kids at a very young age. Busy Beavers is one of the most popular Kids Channels on YouTube because of our Great Songs.
