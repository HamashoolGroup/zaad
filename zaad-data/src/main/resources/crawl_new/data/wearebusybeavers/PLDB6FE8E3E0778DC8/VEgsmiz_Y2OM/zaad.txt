Published on Jan 6, 2014
"The Orange is Orange? That's Ridiculous!" Actually, for Teaching English to Complete Beginners - It's Very Effective. Since 2006 "The Color Game" has taught millions of Non-English Speaking Kids, Toddlers and Autistic Children how to Communicate in English. This is our New HD-Widescreen Version of our hit Busy Beavers Level 1 English Series Lesson Video. Give this video a try in your English Classroom, Daycare, Kindergarten or at home. There are 20 Simple Objects in this video, 2 objects for each of these 10 colors - Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Blue, Black, White, Brown, Pink & Purple. Any Experienced Teacher will be able to think of countless fun ways to use this video to get students engaged and speaking. For Example: Try pausing the video after every question and have your students tell you what color the object will be before they see the correct answer. You can make a game out of it. The student who answers correctly, and in a perfect sentence, can choose the next player - or make up your own rules. How about having two students come up to the front of the class and take turns asking and answering the questions? This could also be a game where the student with the least mistakes is the winner.
