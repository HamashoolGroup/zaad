Educational song teaching English vocabulary. Sing along and learn English! Fire and water land and sea Mountains and valleys birds and bees Flowers and rainbows clouds in the sky Sunrise and sunset the stars at night The world is magic The wind and waves, the snow and rain The world is magic With magical things both small and big Eating and drinking sleeping and dreaming reading and writing swimming and flying Running and walking Hearing and talking growing and dying laughing and crying The world is magic The wind and the waves The world is magic With magical things both small and big.
