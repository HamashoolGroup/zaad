Want to learn more about the techniques talked about in this video? Grab this FREE Memory Improvement Kit: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/f... In this third video in my memorize a shuffled deck of cards series, I used an impromptu Memory Palace based on chairs just outside the cafe window. Normally I would not do this, but it had an interesting effect. I also used columns instead of linear lines of action and clumped the cards into groups of three or four. It works really well and sped up the process. If you're learning to use memory techniques, I highly suggest you explore this column approach in either an established Memory Palace or one you build on the fly. It works great. Talk soon! :) Sincerely, Anthony Metivier
