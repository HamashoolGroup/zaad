Memorize A Shuffled Deck Of Cards Challenge Video 2
Published on Sep 17, 2015
I have a Free Memory Improvement Kit for your here: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/f... You might not want to memorize a shuffled deck of cards, but trust me, it's good mental exercise. Even if you're not using the Magnetic Memory Method to do it, there's a ton of other ways to use mnemonics, a Memory Palace and other memory techniques to make your mind and memory super strong. And as Harry Lorayne once said, even just thinking about memory techniques has a special effect. So I invite you to follow along with this challenge and see what you can learn about the nature of memory.
