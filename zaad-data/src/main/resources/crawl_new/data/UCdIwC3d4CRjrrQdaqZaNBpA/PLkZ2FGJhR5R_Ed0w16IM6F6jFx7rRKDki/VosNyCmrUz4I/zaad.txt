Memorize A Shuffled Deck Of Cards Challenge Video 1
Published on Sep 15, 2015
http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/f... Have you ever wanted to memorize a shuffled deck of cards? If so, follow along with this challenge. You need only a basic understanding of mnemonics, how to use a Memory Palace and other simple to understand aspects of memory techniques. Memorization of cards is a huge part of the World Memory Championships, but you can use the practice to get better at memory in general. It's a fantastic way to develop speed with using a Memory Palace and will make you more creative in many ways. And as I talk about in this video, you can add obstructions that will create greater focus and other kinds of inspiration. Special thanks to Nelson Dellis for giving me the inspiration for the challenge - you rock!
