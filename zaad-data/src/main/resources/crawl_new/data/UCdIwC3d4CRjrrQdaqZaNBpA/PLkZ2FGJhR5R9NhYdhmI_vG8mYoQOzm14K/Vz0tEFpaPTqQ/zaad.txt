http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/f... If you've ever wanted to double, triple or quadruple your memory abilities, then this may be one of the most important books you will ever read. In Warren Hilton's The Trained Memory (with an introduction and commentary by Anthony Metivier), you'll learn: * How to improve your memory using famous icons like the Mona Lisa so that you can easily create powerful mental imagery that will allow you to recall information with ease. * The secrets of using four memory processes that will literally "unlock" your memory abilities. * How to "tune in" on your memory capacities by cultivating a state of awareness in the present. * The importance of "integral recall" and how to use it so that you can overcome the deficits of "ordinary thinking." * The basic principles of "thought reproduction" and how they can be used simplify complex groupings of information and ideas. * The art of compelling yourself to recall information, even when you don't feel up to it. * How to form the correct habits of memory and mnemonics so that you can memorize and recall information systematically and persistently. * How to use memory "tokens" to dramatically increase your recall. * The exact steps to take to improve your attention in order to improve sensory experience and imbue the mind with lightning quickness. * Daily morning routines and drills for increasing your mental capacity for observation, inventive thinking and positivity. * ... and much, much more. Look, none of these techniques require brain surgery, crazy math or rocket science. These are simple strategies that real people have used to achieve massive improvements in their memory abilities simply by learning a few quick tricks, implementing them and changing how they think about the muscle between their ears. But there's really no time to lose. Every day that you're not using the natural abilities of your mind by having a dedicated memorization strategy, you are missing out on walking through an open the door that will make literally anything possible.
