Memory Tips From Aristotle Part One (Trailer)
Published on Feb 2, 2015
http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/f... In this first video of Memory Tips from Aristotle, you'll receive a basic introduction to the course. Think of this as the "trailer." It's a different way of teaching you to understand how to use a memory technique by thinking about the philosophical history of memory. So although there's no direct help in overcoming spaced repetition and rote learning or using a Memory Palace or mnemonics, you're going to hear from one of the first guys to use "mnemonic" in writing and how he talked about memory improvement.
