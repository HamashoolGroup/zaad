Connected Speech & Linking | American English Pronunciation
Published on Mar 5, 2013
Many of my students say they want to sound just like a native English speaker. I understand the desire, but my answer to them is always the same. The goal is not to be perfect, but to progress; to be understood when speaking and to be able to understand English when spoken naturally. One of the most important aspects of pronunciation and listening is to understand that Americans don't just speak fast--as many students believe--but that they connect their words and change the sounds of words. This lesson will help you speak with connected speech and understand native speakers when they use connected speech in their spoken English.
