Published on Jun 10, 2014
Listen to Larissa answer the question, "Do you teach in person in a classroom?" while practicing your English listening skills. (Part 2: NO subtitles) (Part 1 with Subtitles here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGg2R...) TRANSCRIPT: http://www.elementalenglish.com/quest... INSTRUCTIONS: Listen to what I say while reading the text. Notice how I change the language: -What do I stress? -What do I de-stress? -Where does my voice (pitch) go up? -What words and sounds am I connecting? -What words and sounds am I creating from those connections? -What sounds and words am I deleting? Do this several times, then watch the same video without subtitles. Do you understand more? Do this repeatedly. Remember to be an ACTIVE listener!
