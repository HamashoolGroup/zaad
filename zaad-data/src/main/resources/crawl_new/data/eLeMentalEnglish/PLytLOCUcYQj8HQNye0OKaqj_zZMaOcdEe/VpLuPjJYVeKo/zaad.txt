"Are you a Native English Speaker?" (SUBTITLES) | Q&A with Larissa | Practice Your Listening Skills
Published on Jun 8, 2014
A student asked me if I'm a native English speaker. Practice your listening skills while listening to my answer! Note that even as a native English speaker and English teacher, I make some mistakes, too. I could have said things better at times. The goal is NOT perfection, but to be clear and confident! TRANSCRIPT: http://www.elementalenglish.com/quest... INSTRUCTIONS WITH THIS Q&A SERIES 1) Listen to what I say while reading the text. Notice how I change the language: -What do I stress? -What do I de-stress? -Where does my voice (pitch) go up? Down? -What words and sounds am I connecting? -What words and sounds am I creating from those connections? -What sounds and words am I deleting? 2) Repeat several times, then watch the video WITHOUT reading the text.... Do you understand more? 3) Remember to be an ACTIVE listener! NOTICE the language! Get the free iTunes podcast: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/e...
