http://get.pronunciationpro.com/free7... Vist us for details on how you can learn to speak confidently with an American Accent. English pronunciation and accent reduction for non-native English speakers to communicate confidently in their careers, at school, and socially. https://pronunciationpro.com I hear many of the same concerns from my clients. They are fluent in English but their strong foreign accent is limiting to them in their career and life in the United States. They are being passed up on jobs and promotions, they don't feel confident speaking to large groups or unfamiliar listeners. They feel awkward in social interactions because their listener doesn't understand then and asks them to repeat themselves. If this sounds like you then this webinar is for you!
