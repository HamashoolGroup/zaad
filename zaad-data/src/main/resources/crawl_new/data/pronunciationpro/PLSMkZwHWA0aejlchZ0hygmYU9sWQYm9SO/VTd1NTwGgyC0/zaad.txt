Why Your Accent Matters: Getting Your Dream Job or Promotion!
Published on Apr 25, 2013
http://get.pronunciationpro.com/free7... Visit the link above for details on how you can learn to speak confidently with an American Accent. Do any or all of these describe you? - You've spent years learning English - You learned English in native country by someone with an accent - You feel good about English comprehension - You feel good about speaking with familiar listeners - You lose all confidence once you are speaking with native English speakers, with unfamiliar listeners, or in front of a large group - Native English speakers frequently ask you to repeat yourself - "what, say that again" - There are communication breakdowns and you're not sure what you're saying incorrectly - People treat you differently because they don't understand you - Maybe coworkers avoid speaking with you because of the communication problems - Your thoughts and ideas are not given as much attention as you think they should - In your work setting you feel that you have much more to offer than you are giving - You hesitate to speak up during group discussions or meetings - You feel that you could do well in a more advanced position - but don't feel confident in the way you are able to communicate - You feel that your communication skills or simply your accent is keeping you from progressing in your career. You are not alone! Hundreds of thousands of non-native English speakers are in your same position and feel this same frustration. The only difference is that you are seeking a solution whereas they are waking up each morning wishing things were different but doing nothing about it. You are putting yourself in a great position and gaining a very real competitive edge in the marketplace because you are looking to actively work to improve yourself and overcome a very real problem. In this webinar we talked about how you as a non-native English speaker can get that dream job or that next promotion in your current job. I got an email from a past student this week. I had heard that he recently got a new job with the Fortune 500 company, Cisco, and so I emailed him to congratulate him. Here's part of the response I got from him: "The new job is definitely a huge win for me. The compensation and benefit package are awesome. The part I like the most is that the job location is about 20 minutes away from where I live. The previous job was very challenging since I needed to spend at least?100 minutes on the road every single work day. ? It is incredibly useful to utilize all the skills I learned from Pronunciation Pro. Honestly I am still working at it on a daily basis and feel strongly that I am getting better and better".
