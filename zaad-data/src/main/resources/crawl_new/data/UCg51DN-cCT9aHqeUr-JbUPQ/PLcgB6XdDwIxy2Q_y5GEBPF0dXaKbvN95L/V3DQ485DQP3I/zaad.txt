Alice in Wonderland 5: Advice from a caterpillar - BBC Learning English
Published on Jan 26, 2016
Alice is beginning to wonder who she is, when a caterpillar gives her some advice about a magical mushroom. But is it good advice ? and who thinks Alice is a snake? Narrator: After Alice frightened everyone by growing as big as a house, she ate some little cakes and shrank again. She doesn't like being so tiny, so she's looking for something to make her grow to the right size. But this is Wonderland and what she finds, sitting on top of a mushroom, is very curious indeed?
