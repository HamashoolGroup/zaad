BBC Learning English - The English We Speak: Use your loaf
Published on Jan 26, 2016
The script for this programme Rob: Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob and a very hungry-looking Li. Li: (mouth full of food) Hello. Rob: Erm, Li, you're talking with your mouth full. Can you wait till lunchtime please? Li: No I can't - I'm starving. Rob: Well, be careful - you're making such a mess in here. Li: Ever since I started jogging before work, I just have to eat a big snack mid-morning or I feel faint by lunchtime. Rob: Well, maybe, but you know you're not supposed to eat food in the studio. It's a really bad idea - you could damage the equipment. Oh no - look! There's salad and mayonnaise all over the recording desk! Li, use your loaf! Li: Use my loaf? Yes, that's a good idea. If I use bread, I can make a sandwich, which will be much tidier. Rob: No, I mean use your brain - think about things before you do them! Li: Eh? Rob: Well, in English, if you are slightly annoyed with someone because they are doing something they haven't thought about properly, you can say 'use your loaf'. Li: Oh I see. Loaf here is slang for head. Rob: That's right. It's a little old-fashioned but it's still something you might hear. My parents or grandparents would use it for when I did something a bit? stupid. Li: Here are some examples. Old man: Use your loaf, son. Don't ride your bike on the motorway at night without lights. You'll get yourself killed. Dad: Why oh why oh why were you playing football in your school trousers?! Use your loaf! You have holes in your knees again! Child: Sorry, Daddy. Li: So, 'use your loaf' means think about things before you do them otherwise you will make silly mistakes. Rob: That's right. So Li, use your loaf and stop eating food in the studio. Li: Yes, next time I'll use my loaf and eat sandwiches. Rob: No, don't eat food of any kind in the studio ? not even sandwiches. Li: But sandwiches are nice and tidy. Rob: No they're not. You'll get lots of little crumbs everywhere. Li: How about an apple? Rob: No! Juice might drip! Li: A banana? Rob: No Li... oh goodness!
