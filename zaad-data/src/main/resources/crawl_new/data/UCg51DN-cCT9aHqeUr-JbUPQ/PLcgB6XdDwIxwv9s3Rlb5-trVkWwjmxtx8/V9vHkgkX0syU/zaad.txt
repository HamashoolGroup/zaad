When you're listening to someone explain something or tell you something, how can you show that person that you understand him or her? How can you indicate that you are following what is being said - or not following it? In this programme, we look at different ways you can do this using body language, noises, words and intonation. Vocabulary to follow someone / something here, to understand something or someone e.g. After a while, I stopped following the conversation. Sorry - I don't follow you. Can you explain it again? to nod to move your head up and down, usually in agreement to run somebody through something to explain something e.g. Can you quickly run me through the new guidelines? Hang on / Hold on Use this to ask someone to stop or pause e.g. Hold on - I don't think I follow you Can you just hang on a second? I need to get my coat... to be lost here, to no longer understand e.g. Aaagh! I'm totally lost! to lose someone here, to confuse someone or lead to them not understanding you e.g. Hang on - you've lost me!
