English at Work 7: Mr Lime's grapefruit - BBC Learning English
Published on Jan 31, 2016
Mr Lime is not happy. He ordered grapefruit from Tip Top Trading, but he got pineapples. Anna has to apologise and sort everything out. How embarrassing! Apologising This episode looks at language for apologising to people. Phrases from the programme: I'm really sorry to hear that. That's totally unacceptable. It must have been very inconvenient for you. You have my word that we will sort this out. And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience. I promise you, it won't happen again.
