Published on Mar 22, 2016
Anna and Denise are flapping following the call from Mr Lime asking Anna out to lunch. She wants to say no, but doesn?t want to sound rude. Her dilemma is how to turn him down politely. She finally plucks up the courage to call him, but how does he respond? Language for politely refusing This week's programme focuses on politely refusing a request to do something. Phrases from the programme: Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to. I'm afraid it is against company policy? It wouldn't be appropriate. With regret, I'm going to have to say no. Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/lea...
