Published on Feb 6, 2016
Helen has been nominated for an important role on the Parents Association, but she?s having nightmares about it. Neil comes up with a plan and tells her to drop it before it becomes ?a hot potato?. Transcript Neil Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil. Helen Hello everyone. I?m Helen. Neil Oh what?s the matter, Helen? You look really tired. Helen Is it that bad? Neil You've got very dark shadows under your eyes. Helen Oh dear. Well, I?ve been pushed into a role and I don?t really want it. Neil What is it? Helen To be the treasurer for the school?s parents association and you know I am hopeless with numbers. Neil Sounds like it could turn into a hot potato for you. Helen Hot potato? Do you mean a jacket potato? No I am not hungry, I am nervous. Neil I'm not talking about food. I am talking about this job. I can see it?s going to be a problem for you. Helen I?m thinking the same. Neil You need to think about it very carefully before it becomes a hot potato. When something becomes a ?hot potato?, it becomes a problem and difficult to handle. Helen I see. You can?t hold a hot potato in your hand. It would burn you. Neil Exactly, you?ve got it. A hot potato is a phrase we use to refer to difficult or tricky situations, or even people. Here are a few examples: Examples The shortage of housing supply is fast becoming a hot potato for the council. The pay rise issue is a hot potato for management; I don't know how they are going to sort this one out between the staff, the union and the shareholders. Neil Helen, my word of advice is? Helen Please, I?m listening. Neil Just tell the school you can?t do it. Drop it before it becomes a real hot potato for you. Helen You are right. That?s what I will do. Thanks Neil You?re welcome.
