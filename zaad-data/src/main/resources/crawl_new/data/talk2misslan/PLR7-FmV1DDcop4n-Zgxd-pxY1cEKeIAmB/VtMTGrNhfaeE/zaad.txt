Tiny Corner Cafe - English Speaking Happy Hour
Published on Mar 1, 2015
Tiny Corer Caf? is a not-for-profit English caf? project founded in 2011 by Ms Lan Huynh, an inspirational English teacher in town. The caf? is famous for its ?English Speaking Happy Hour?, which happens on every Monday, Thursday and Saturday evening, starting from 7:00PM. This is the time when young locals, expats and tourists gather to help one another practice speaking English, share stories and make new friends. After almost three years of operation, Tiny Corner Caf? has helped thousands of local students improve their confidence in speaking English as well as enhance their language?s proficiency. This caf? also acts as a meeting point, a connecting bridge between locals, expats and tourists in Can Tho. Unlike the floating markets and other typical tourist attractions, the ?English Speaking Happy Hour? at Tiny Corner may be the only place that tourists can freely hang out with real locals and get to learn more about the Mekong?s people and their culture through many different interesting stories being told by multi-level English speakers. The caf? currently opens for three nights only (Monday, Thursday and Saturday) and there is a small participation fee (20,000 to 30,000vnd) per head as to support the project to run. More information can be found on Tiny Corner?s facebook page. *** www.facebook.com/tinycornercafe *** Any donations are greatly appreciated by our community in Can Tho City.
