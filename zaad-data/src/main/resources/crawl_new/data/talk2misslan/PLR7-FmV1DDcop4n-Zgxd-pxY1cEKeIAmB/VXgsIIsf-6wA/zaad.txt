Tiny Corner Cafe - A great community
Published on Aug 27, 2015
Tiny Corner is known as the first English Cafe in Can Tho where locals gather to speak English and make new friends. Tiny Corner adapts the model of "English Speaking Happy Hour" from Verona, Italia, where speaking English makes them happy. The English Speaking Happy Hour at Tiny Corner Cafe happens from 7:00PM every Monday, Thursday and Saturday; and the English Musical Show happens at 7:30PM every Sunday. The cafe is also known as the perfect place for tourists and travelers to make friends and get to know about culture of Mekong Delta through the stories shared by English Speaking Happy Hour participants. Since April 2015, Tiny Corner has brought back the English Musical Show which happens on every Sunday night from 7:30PM. At this time, you'll be able to listen to the best English-playing band in town performing their favorite playlist with some very modern pop songs. Got a song to request? No problem, bring it on, we'll play it for you! No entrance tickets required, members buy drinks at the door to join these activities. Find more about us at: Tiny Corner Cafe 14/7 L? T?
