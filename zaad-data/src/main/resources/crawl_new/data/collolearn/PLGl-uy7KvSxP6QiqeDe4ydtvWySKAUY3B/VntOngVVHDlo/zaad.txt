Best way ever to motivate even the most unmotivated teenagers to learn the English verbs! You wouldn't believe it! Teenagers from different countries attend the English camps in Luxembourg and are actually having a lot of fun learning grammar and vocabulary and improving their English! We are very proud of our students and teachers @ Languages.lu ! School: Languages.lu www.languages.lu Song and lyrics: MC Fluency, Jason R Levine, ?Stick Stuck Stuck?
