Having Fun ( Past Participle Rap of Some Irregular Verbs performed by Hamza)
Published on Feb 14, 2014
This video is inspired by Fluency Mc with a different instrumental beat chosen by the MC/student/ Hamza. It is a lyrical rap of some irregular past forms and past participle forms ; meanwhile, it is a very enjoyable way to learn them by heart. In fact, there are some slips of tongue; still, it has been enjoyable and was worth + 1 !! Camera-Woman: Ayadi Copyrights: The Speedologist Special Thanks to Fluency Mc .
