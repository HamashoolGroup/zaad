Check out Talha and Fabian (on beatbox!) from the Erich K?stner School in Hesse, Germany.

Do or make? Thinking about it will make your brain ache. Do yourself a favor. Give yourself a break. Relax and Repeat, for Fluency?s sake. I make sure to do my homework; then, I hit the sack. I make a to-do list to stay on track. I need to do a few errands; I?ll be right back. Make yourself at home; be my guest; make a snack! I make the bed in the morning and do laundry at night. I don?t make fun of people-that?s impolite- or make a fist or do harm to someone in a fight. I?d rather do good, make peace, and unite. You?ve got to do your duty to make things right.
