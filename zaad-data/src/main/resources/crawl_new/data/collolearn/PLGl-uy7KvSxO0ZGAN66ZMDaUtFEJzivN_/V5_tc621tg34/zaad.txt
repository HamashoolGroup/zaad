Published on May 14, 2012
Education met entertainment during Jason Levine's two-week tour of Tunisia. In visits to Tunis, Manouba, Nabeul, Hammamet, Sousse, Jendouba and Sfax, Jason shared his teaching methods with more than one thousand students and teachers across the country, using songs and hip hop to promote accurate and fluent use of the English language and to foster critical thinking skills. Levine is as an English Language Specialist with the U.S. Department of State and the Academic Director of CAMPUS Education, an English language school with centers in the U.S. and overseas. This program was sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Tunis and is part of America's continuing support for education in Tunisia.
