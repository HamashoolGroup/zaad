Collos in the Car!
Uploaded on May 9, 2010
Lola shadows adjective-noun Collos on the way home from Oliver's French class. (You can hear Oliver's pleas to make a pit stop; and his hair makes a brief cameo!) This track is on the new ColloTunes CD entitled A to Z: Sounds, Spellings, and Collos. It can be purchased in a package with A to Z ColloCards.
