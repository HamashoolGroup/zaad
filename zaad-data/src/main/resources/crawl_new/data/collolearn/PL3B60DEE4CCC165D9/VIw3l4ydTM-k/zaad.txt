Introducing Lola, ESL Teacher
Uploaded on Feb 15, 2010
A two year-old makes the perfect English teacher for beginning students! Listen for these QUESTIONS: What are you eating? Is it yummy? What's in your hair? What else do you like to eat? Can I see it? Should we show the movie? And these COLLOs! Peas and carrots. It's good. Chocolate ones. It's my favorite. That's right.
