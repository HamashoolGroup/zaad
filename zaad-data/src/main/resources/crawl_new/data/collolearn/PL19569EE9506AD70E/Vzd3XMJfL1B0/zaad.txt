Levine and ColloLearn, llc Say "Happy Halloween!" Again! Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat! Give me something good to eat! Halloween is coming. What are you going to do? Dress up as a ghost and say, "Boo!"? Halloween is coming. What are you going to be? A pirate? A princess? A bumblebee? Halloween is coming. What are you going to wear? A scary mask? Long blond hair? Halloween is coming. Where are you going to go? To a haunted house? A horror movie show? What are you going to do on Halloween night? Carve a pumpkin? Howl at the moonlight? Will you gobble down goodies until you're feeling sick, or ride through the sky on a broomstick? What are you going to be for Halloween? Batman? A witch? A fairy queen? Are you going to go out to trick-or-treat? And bring home a bag full of candy to eat? Happy Halloween! Come on! Happy Halloween! Trick or Treat! I said, Trick or Treat! Give me something good to eat!
