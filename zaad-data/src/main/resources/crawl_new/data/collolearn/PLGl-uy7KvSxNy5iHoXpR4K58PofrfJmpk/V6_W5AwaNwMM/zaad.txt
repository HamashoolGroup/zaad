Jason R. Levine (Fluency MC) in M'saken, Tunisia (April 26, 2012)
Published on Apr 27, 2012
Jason's known as Fluency MC but you can just call him Jase. He teaches EFL all over the place. He's a high-stress drainer, language explainer, knowledge entertainer, and ELT sustainer! Neither is he an actor nor a feigner but an exceptional teacher and trainer.
