FCE LINKING WORDS part 2
Published on Jul 3, 2014
This English lesson looks at the different linking words which link conditional clauses and add information. Words such as 'unless, until, in case, furthermore, for instance' and many others are examined in terms of their meaning and function. This is part of a course I am making for students taking the FCE exam, and this information will be especially useful for the writing and use of English papers.
