''used to, be/get used to'' - Lesson 12
Published on Jul 7, 2013
How do we use USED TO and BE/GET USED TO in English? This video is aimed at intermediate level and above, and I attempt to remind the student why we use all the different tenses as well as give them the passive structure for each tense. I hope you like it! I have lots of other FREE materials - ebooks with English lessons (based on TV shows) http://www.scribd.com/Skypelessons http://issuu.com/daveskypelessons Elementary Grammar http://www.skype-lessons.com/lang-en/... Phrasal verbs http://www.skype-lessons.com/lang-en/... Vocabulary http://www.skype-lessons.com/lang-en/... Tenses http://www.skype-lessons.com/lang-en/... I am also available (timetable permitting) for private lessons on Skype.
