Perfect Infinitive + Perfect Gerund - Lesson 16
Published on Oct 26, 2015
In this English lesson we focus on perfect forms of the infinitive and the gerund. I hope to demonstrate that the perfect infinitive or gerund is the same as the perfect tense with a to + infinitive or gerund form. https://www.skype-lessons.com/online-... to have + 3rd = perfect infinitive (with to) having + 3rd = perfect gerund Examples: PERFECT INFINITIVE 1) With adjectives: I'm glad/pleased/delighted/disappointed (adjective) to have met him last week. 2) With certain verbs (claim, seem, hope, expect, prefer, like, love, hate, pretend) He claims not to have been anywhere near the scene of the crime. The letter seems to have been written in a hurry. I'd like to have met him last week. We hope to have finished it by the end of the year. PERFECT GERUND (finished gerund) Having read the newspaper, I went out for a walk. Having had a shower, I cooked my breakfast. Please go to my website for more lessons, quizzes and TV show lessons.
