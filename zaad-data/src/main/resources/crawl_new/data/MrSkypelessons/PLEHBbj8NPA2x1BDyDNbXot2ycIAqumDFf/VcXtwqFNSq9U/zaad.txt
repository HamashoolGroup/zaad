Present Simple and Present Continuous - Lesson 1
Published on Nov 12, 2012
This is an English lesson which concentrates on present simple and present continuous and when they should be used. It is the first class of an intermediate course for learning English tenses. It also deals with STATE VERBS (also known as stative verbs) which are very important because they can never be used in continuous tenses. https://www.skype-lessons.com/blog/en...
