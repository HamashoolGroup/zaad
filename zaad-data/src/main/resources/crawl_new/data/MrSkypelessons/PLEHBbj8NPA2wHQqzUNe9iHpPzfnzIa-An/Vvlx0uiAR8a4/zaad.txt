Elementary English. Lesson 15. Gerund or to + infinitive
Published on Mar 26, 2013
What are gerunds, and 'to + infinitive'? How do we use them? This elementary lesson explains the difference between gerunds and to + infinitive, and how to use them effectively in English. USE GERUND AFTER THESE VERBS (I hate going to the shops!) like, love, hate, enjoy start, finish, stop, begin suggest, recommend, regret, admit, avoid, deny can't stand, can't bear, can't help mind, imagine, keep, miss prefer, risk, practice USE INFINITIVE (without to) AFTER ALL MODAL VERBS (I can't stop smoking) would, should, can, could, may, might, will, and negative forms too. USE INFINITIVE (with to) AFTER MOST OTHER VERBS (I want to go to the cinema) USE GERUNDS AFTER PREPOSITIONS (He's interested in learning English) USE GERUNDS AS THE SUBJECT OF THE SENTENCE (Cooking is lots of fun) USE INFINITIVE (with to) AFTER ADJECTIVES (It's difficult to study a new language) USE INFINITIVE (with to) TO SHOW PURPOSE (Let's go to the shops to buy some milk) More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on gerunds and infinitives here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlx0u...
