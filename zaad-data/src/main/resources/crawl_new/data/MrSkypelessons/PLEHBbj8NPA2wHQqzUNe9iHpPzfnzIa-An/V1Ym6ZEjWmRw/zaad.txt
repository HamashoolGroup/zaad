Elementary English. Lesson 9. Much and many. Few and little
Published on Feb 10, 2013
What is the difference between much/many and few/little? How do we use them? Find out in this elementary English lesson. Use MUCH and LITTLE with uncountable nouns (How much water do you have? I don't have much money. There is very little work for us to do) Use MANY and FEW with countable nouns (How many oranges are left? I don't have many friends. There are very few houses in this street) More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on gerunds and infinitives here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlx0u...
