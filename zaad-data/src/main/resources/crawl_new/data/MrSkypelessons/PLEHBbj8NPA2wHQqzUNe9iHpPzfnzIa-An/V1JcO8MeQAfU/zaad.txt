Published on Mar 11, 2013
How do we use the passive voice? This elementary lesson explains the difference between active and passive, as well as how we form passive in English. PRESENT SIMPLE = is/are/am + 3rd form (Rice is grown in China. Toyota cars are made in Japan) PAST SIMPLE = was/were + 3rd form (I was born in England. He was killed in Korea) More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on gerunds and infinitives here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlx0u...
