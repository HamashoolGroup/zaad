Modals of deduction
Published on Oct 22, 2012
In this intermediate lesson we learn how to use modal verbs in the present and past tense. In the present tense they are formed as MUST + be, CAN'T + be and COULD / MAY / MIGHT + be. In the past tense they are MUST HAVE + 3rd form COULD / MAY / MIGHT + 3rd form CAN'T HAVE + 3rd form (COULDN'T HAVE + 3rd is also possible) More lessons and quizzes on my blog https://www.skype-lessons.com/blog/mo...
