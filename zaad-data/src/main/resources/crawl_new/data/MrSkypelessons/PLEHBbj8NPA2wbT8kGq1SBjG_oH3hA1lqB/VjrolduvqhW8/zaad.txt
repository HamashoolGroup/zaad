Punctuation Lessons: COLONS AND SEMICOLONS
Published on Oct 30, 2015
This lesson which deals with the comma is part of a series of lessons I am making on how we use punctuation marks. Please go to my website for more information. https://www.skype-lessons.com/online-... USE COLONS (1 clause must be independent) 1) To explain, conclude, or follow from the main clause There's one thing I really loathe: impatience. We had two options: pay the money or suffer the consequences. There are two ways we could do this: the easy way or the hard way. 2) In direct speech The teacher would say the following: 'Do your homework!' 3) In lists Pancakes are made from simple ingredients: eggs, flour, and milk. USE SEMICOLONS (2 clauses must be independent) 1) Offers additional or contrasting information. Demonstrates a relation between the two independent clauses. (It replaces the coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, so, yet, nor, as, or) I ordered lamb; she had a salad. I'd love to visit Italy; I've always loved Italian food. 2) Use with the following conjunctive adverbs: otherwise, however, moreover, therefore, nevertheless, consequently, accordingly, consequently, instead. We didn't go to the museum; instead, we went home. 3 students came to the class; however, only 1 was prepared. Exercises here.
