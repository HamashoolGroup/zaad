Advanced Vocabulary Course: lesson 2
Published on Sep 30, 2015
This advanced vocabulary course is designed to work in tandem with episodes on the US version of Sherlock called 'Elementary', and exercises on my website. You can find more grammar and vocabulary questions here: https://www.skype-lessons.com/advance... I advise students to do the following: read the exercises, check any unknown vocabulary, watch the show, answer the questions, and then retell it using the target vocabulary and grammar. The retelling is necessary to activate new phrases in an easy to remember context. Please repeat the vocabulary using this video and the questions which accompany the video. Please subscribe for the whole course. Lessons will be released on a weekly basis. And please answer the following questions: How often do you go on a binge? Why might the police insist on having an autopsy? Do you know any twins? Are they identical or fraternal? Do they bear a striking resemblance to one another? Do you have any genetic disorders? Do you know anyone who has sued, or has been sued? Who will you bequeath your fortune to? Do you know anyone who has inherited a great deal of money? Have you had a lot on your plate recently? 1) Holmes accused her doctor of inducing her coma 2) Holmes suggested stabbing her in the thigh 3) Holmes advised Gregson to check the victim for a rare genetic eye disorder 4) Holmes threatened to sue Watson for breach of contract 5) Gregson admitted finding no discernible link (that he hadn't found any..) 6) Holmes reminded Watson (that) they only bear a passing resemblance to each other. 7) Dave warned us not to forget this new vocabulary. https://www.skype-lessons.com/
