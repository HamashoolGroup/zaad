FCE LINKING WORDS part 1
Published on Jun 30, 2014
This English lesson looks at the different linking words which contrast, compare and establish cause and effect. Words such as 'due to'', 'consequently', 'so as', 'nevertheless', 'despite', 'although' and many others are examined in terms of their meaning and function. This is part of a course I am making for students taking the FCE exam, and this information will be especially useful for the writing and use of English papers. https://www.skype-lessons.com/linking...
