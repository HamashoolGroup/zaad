When I go walking I see circles Everywhere I go A circle is round like a steering wheel It?s shaped just like an ?O? Like the big bright sun And a cinnamon bun And the wheels on a bicycle Round and round they go Like a big balloon Like the big full moon How many kinds of circles Do you know? Squares! I see squares when we go to town They?re everywhere you turn They have four sides of the very same length Let?s see what we can learn Like a pizza box And my toy blocks Equal sides of 1,2,3,and 4 Like a picture frame Or a windowpane A square is just a shape that I adore Triangles! Here and there I find triangles Look around and see And a triangle has three sides One and two and three Like a pizza slice A piece of pie is nice How about a great big Ice cream cone? Like a volcano Or the sail on my boat Or a steeple, or the shape of the roof That?s on my home Rectangles! I share my house With a lot of rectangles Let?s just take a look With two sides long And two sides short They?re shaped just like a book Like my front door And the rug on my floor Like a fridge, like a brick Like a bed, like a stereo Like a Kleenex box And my grandfather clock I see rectangles Everywhere I go! There are many kinds of shapes I see them everywhere I love circles and rectangles Triangles and squares.
