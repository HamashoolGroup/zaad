Traditional English Teaching Industry Just Won?t Change!
Published on Mar 19, 2016
In this video I?m responding to Alejandro?s comment about the traditional English teaching industry: ?Listen Rob... just a couple of days ago, I quit my job as an English Primary School Teacher, owe to the fact that I do not fit the standards of Mexican Education which is worth a f*&*ing half of dime... Look? language education around here only beats the bush around writing and writing and focusing so much on grammar, which actually prevents students from performing English in a more native like fashion. Hopefully, this can be a proof which testifies how hard is to change the traditional approach which is only committed on fulfilling attendance lists and grading with numbers which actually reflects nothing but big time, major league bullshit. Anyway Rob, maybe you have some words which may help to stop the way traditional education scars still lingers my very intelligence and my very soul...?
