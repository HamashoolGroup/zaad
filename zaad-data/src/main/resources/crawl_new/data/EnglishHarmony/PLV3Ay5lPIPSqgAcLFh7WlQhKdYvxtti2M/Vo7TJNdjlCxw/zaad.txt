Why Is It So HARD to Realize You Have to Speak in Order to Speak?
Published on Jan 22, 2015
This video is a follow-up on the last video you can check out here http://englishharmony.com/you-are-wha... and it?s also a direct response to Juhapekka?s comment where he expresses his opinion on why it?s so hard for us, foreigners, to see that in order to develop good speaking skills we have to practice speaking. Here?s what Juhapekka has to say: I think that one reason behind this is some kind of subconscious paradox in our minds: I want to speak English and the only way to learn to speak English is by speaking but I CAN'T SPEAK so how an earth I can learn to speak English by speaking because specifically speaking is the skill I can't do!
