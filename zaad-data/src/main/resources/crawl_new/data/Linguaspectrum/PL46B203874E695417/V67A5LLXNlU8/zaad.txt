It's also a boring household chore. It's a homophone, too.In this video we'll keep an eye on iron. Notice one thing first. There is no /r/ sound in the word iron. It's iron. /????n/ If you learn nothing more from this video, learn this. I don't think I have ever had a student who has not wanted to pronounce the /r/ sound. There is no such thing as iron with an /r/ unless your name is Ron and you are not very good at English. As far as metals go, iron is the most useful and most abundant metal on Earth.Iron is everywhere. Look around you. How many things are made of it or contain some of it?
