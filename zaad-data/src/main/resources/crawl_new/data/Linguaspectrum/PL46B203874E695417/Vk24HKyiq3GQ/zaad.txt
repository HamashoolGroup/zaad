Without electricity you wouldn't be watching this video now. But what exactly is electricity? Electricity gets its name from amber. It gets its name from amber because amber was the first material to be shown to develop an electrical charge when rubbed with wool. The Greek for amber was elektron. Now, of course, when somebody first rubbed a piece of amber with a handful of wool they had no idea what electricity was. What they noticed, however, was that the amber they rubbed was suddenly able to attract anything light placed near it, like a scrap of paper or a feather. We now know that this force of attraction is produced by a build-up of electrons on the amber.
