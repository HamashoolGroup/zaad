Learn more at http://linguaspectrum.com I have always felt that my Daily Dose of English series of video English lessons never received the attention they deserved. I thought it was a shame that the best of them were going to waste, viewed only a few thousand times. So I decided to bring the best of the Daily Doses together in what I believe to be the longest video English lesson on YouTube. This also makes it the most convenient way to learn about everything from question words to Shakespeare. Just hit the play button and sit back to enjoy two hours of me teaching you English. Two hours of English with Richard. My favourite bits from my Daily Doses of English. Is this the longest video English lesson on YouTube? Share it and leave a comment.
