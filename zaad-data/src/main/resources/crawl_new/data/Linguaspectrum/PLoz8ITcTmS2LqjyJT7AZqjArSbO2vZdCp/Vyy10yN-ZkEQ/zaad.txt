Do you think this is funny? Vote now at http://linguaspectrum.com/clive-snyde... Clive Snyde business guru here with today's Snyde Comment on the world of business. The world of business is a like a tree full of monkeys. All the monkeys are climbing up, except those that have fallen off, of course. When the monkeys at the top look down, they see desperate faces with ingratiating smiles. This sight strengthens their grip and makes them climb ever faster upwards. When those same desperate climbers at the bottom look up, they see nothing but arseholes above them. Welcome to the world of business.
