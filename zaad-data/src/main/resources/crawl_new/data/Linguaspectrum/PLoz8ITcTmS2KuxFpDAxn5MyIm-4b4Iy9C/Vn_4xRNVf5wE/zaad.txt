The British English Expression - A Bunch of Fives
Published on Jun 25, 2015
? The British English Expression - A Bunch of Fives. To give someone a bunch of fives is to punch them with your fist. My brother can be a bit of a plonker, but that's no reason to give him a bunch of fives, especially on holiday. He was supposed to have fixed this! I've a good mind to give him a bunch of fives when I next see him. Thank you for watching this video and remember that you can support my work and future videos ??http://gofundme.com/britlish ?
