Vote for this joke and learn more at http://linguaspectrum.com/wear-the-fo... My new Russian bride, Tatiana, is not speaking to me anymore. I bought? I met her on a Russian dating website and she's only just moved in with me. We're waiting for the visa, you see. Anyway, Tatiana got beaten up by some animal rights activists in Worcester and she blames me. "What shall I wear to Worcester?" she asked me. It's not Worcester, it's Worcester, and it took me a minute to figure out what she meant. For some reason, she seems to think that I said "Worcester, wear the fox hat."
