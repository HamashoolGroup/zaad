Onion Skin

How funny is this joke. Vote at http://linguaspectrum.com/onion-skin/ An onion walks into a bar. Onion: "A pint of your very best Britlish bitter, my good man, and a glass of white wine for my wife." Barman: "I'm sorry, sir, but we don't serve food in here." Why is this funny? It's funny because of the ambiguity in the term serve food. In many UK pubs you can order drinks, like beer, and food to eat with it. To serve means to sell or provide someone with something. Many pubs serve both food and drinks. Some pubs, however, don't sell, or serve, food. They only sell, or serve, alcoholic drinks. An onion is a type of food. When the barman says, "we don't serve food", it could also be taken to mean, "we don't serve a certain type of customer." Notice the pronunciation of the word onion / ??n.j?n /. Many students mispronounce it. If you know your onions, you won't mispronounce it.
