Can you guess what the thing is that is being described? A riddle is a kind of brain-teaser. Riddles have been very popular throughout the history of the English language. I've written this English riddle to test your understanding of the English language in a fun and entertaining way. Some ancient riddles, like the Riddle of the Sphinx in Greek mythology, could mean the difference between life and death. This riddle, you will be pleased to hear, is not so deadly, though it is a challenge, I promise.
