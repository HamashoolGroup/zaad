A Terrible Mistake - Learn English Faster with Laughter
Published on Jan 14, 2016
How funny is this joke. Vote for it at: http://linguaspectrum.com/a-terrible-... Lawyers are the butt of many jokes, just as mothers-in-law are. Lawyers are seen as money-grabbing, dishonest folk. There are numerous lawyer jokes, none of them in the least bit flattering towards the profession of lawyer. This joke is actually two jokes in one. Disclaimer: Personally, I have nothing against lawyers. They are as essential a part of life as wasps and cockroaches.
