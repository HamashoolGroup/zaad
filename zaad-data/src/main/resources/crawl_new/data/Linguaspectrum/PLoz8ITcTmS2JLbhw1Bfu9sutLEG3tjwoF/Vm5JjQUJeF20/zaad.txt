How to Say the Consonant /l/ in British English
Published on Sep 10, 2015
How to say the consonant sound /l/ in British English. I really made this video to test some new animated characters I've been playing with. It's pretty amazing what you can do with computers today, don't you think? Find out what software I used at http://linguaspectrum.com To make this consonant sound, put the tip of your tongue behind your top teeth. This is a voiced consonant, so you should feel your vocal cords vibrating as you say it. The /l/ is found down at the bottom of the British English IPA chart. If you would like to know how to say all 44 of the sounds of British English, visit http://Britlish.com. You can buy my eBook, or an online course. My eBook is available in the Kindle store, too. Find it at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014... Thanks for watching, and I'll be back with something new soon. Goodbye for now.
