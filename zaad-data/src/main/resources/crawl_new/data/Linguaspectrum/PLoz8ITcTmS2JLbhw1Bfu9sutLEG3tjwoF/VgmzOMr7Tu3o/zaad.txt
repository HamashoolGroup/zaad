Hares and Hairs - Learn English Faster with Laughter
Published on Dec 22, 2015
Vote for the funniness of this joke: http://linguaspectrum.com/hare-and-hair/ The humour in this video comes from the fact that the two homophones, hare and hair, are pronounced exactly the same. Hairs are what you have on top of your head, unless you are bald like Tony. Hares are animals that look like large rabbits. A head full of rabbits might indeed look like a full head of hares, especially from a distance. Unfortunately for Tony, it will never look like a full head of hair. If you find yourself going bald, don't make the same mistake as Tony. Try a toupee or a wig instead.
