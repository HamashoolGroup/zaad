This is not really a joke, but the humour comes from the ambiguity of the sentence, Driven to desperation by hunger, even a frog can make a delicious meal. The ambiguity arises because it is not clear who is driven to desperation by hunger, the frog or someone else. As it stands, this sentence sounds as if it is the frog which is going to prepare the meal, when it is the frog itself that will become the meal. To remove the ambiguity, we can make the subject of the sentence clear: Driven to desperation by hunger, you would be happy to eat a frog.
