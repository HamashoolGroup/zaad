In these videos I help you improve your English by doing some useful English accent training (British accent training) so that you can hear me speak British English and practise your own British accent / English accent with these British accent training / English accent training videos. My British English websites Youtube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/CJWorkman... Facebook group: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=g... British English Wordpress blog: http://learnbritishenglish.wordpress.... My Twitter account for teaching English is @UKEnglishTweets at this page: https://twitter.com/#!/UKEnglishTweets Tumblr video blog: http://www.tumblr.com/blog/learnbriti... In this video I concentrate helping you with difficult bits of pronunciation, including some minimal pairs. Notes Minimal pairs: http://www.englishclub.com/pronunciat... Lily red ride: r-eye-d read: reeed / red (past participle / past simple -- as above) raider: ray-duh Cilene man / men cheap / chip: cheeep / chip beat / bit: beeet / bit The "i" song is particularly difficult too, I think we don't have this song in any romance language. Your name, for example, would sound "Chrees" http://www.englishclub.com/pronunciat... During many years, I've never noticed that the "oo" in "good" is not the same as the "oe" in "shoes". wooed / wood: woood / wuhd shoes / good: shoos / guhd good = wood = should = could food: foood beautiful: byou-t(uh)-fool optimistic: op-t(uh)-miss-tik easy: ee-zee Using either - and neither too! Too In this context the same meaning as "also" or "as well". "I like football too." Either: eee-thur / eye-thur Describing a choice or selection of items. "I'll buy you either a dress or shoes. Not both." Neither: neee-thur / neye-thur Negative form of "either" -- for negative ideas and statements. "I don't like football." "Me neither." Listen to this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7sYNp... At 1:30, the man sings about the difference in pronunciation. Listen carefully! Neither...nor... Linking negative statements. (Negative of "either...or...") "I am neither hungry nor tired."
