In this lesson I discuss common ways to ask someone about how they are to begin friendly conversations, before explaining how to describe how you are. Different ways to ask, "How are you?" How's it going? What's going on? How is everything? Everything all right? How've you been? What's happening? All right? What's the story? How's tricks? What's up? (American) How's it hanging? (Slang) How are you? Fine (f-eye-n) "I'm fine thanks, how about you?" Not bad "Not bad cheers, what about you?" Can't complain Good "I'm good, and you?" OK (oh-kay) All right Well Very well Hungry (hung-gree) Starving Tired Exhausted (egg-ZOAR-stid) Knackered (NAH-kud) Thirsty (THUR-stee) Nervous (NUR-vuss) Worried (WO-reed) Upset Angry (ANG-gree) Fuming (FYOO-ming)
