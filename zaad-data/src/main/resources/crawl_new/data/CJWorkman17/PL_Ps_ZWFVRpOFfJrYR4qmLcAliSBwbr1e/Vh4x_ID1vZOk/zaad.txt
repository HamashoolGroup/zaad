Skype username: BritishEnglish_Teacher Those who speak in received pronunciation (not very common) pronounce the ?a? in certain words quite long and low (?). Note: Received pronunciation is not spoken by many English people and sounds a tad ?posh?. It is not as common as most people think. People speaking in a generic southern English accent (e.g. me) make that sound a bit longer and higher (?). People from the English ?Westcountry? (e.g. Somerset) often have a particular way of pronouncing the ?a? vowel sound. It?s long and the mouth is wide when speaking. EXAMPLES ?Grass?; ?Bath? (city); ?Tractor?; ?Somerset?
