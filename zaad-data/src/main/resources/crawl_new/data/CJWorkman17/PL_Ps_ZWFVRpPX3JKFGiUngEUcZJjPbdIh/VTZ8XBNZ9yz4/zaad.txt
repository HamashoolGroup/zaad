If the last letter of the first word is a vowel as well, an "r" sound often links the words (see below): The idea (r)of it India (r)and China A media (r)event Pasta (r)and sauce Saw (r)and conquered Law (r)and Order The linking (intrusive) letter sound seems to depend on the vowel sound at the end of the first word: I (y)am I (y)answered She (y)understands We (y)are Me (y)and you You (w)and me You (w)are You (w)enter When the second word starts with a vowel but the first word does not end with one, it is common to pronounce the last letter of the first word at the beginning of the second word instead. The hea (t)of the day The passio (n)of the man They (y)entered the restaurant Don (ch)ou know? (Don't you know?)
