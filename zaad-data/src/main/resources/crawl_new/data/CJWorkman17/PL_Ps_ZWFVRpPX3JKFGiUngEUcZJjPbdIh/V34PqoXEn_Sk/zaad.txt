Use "in" to specify which month an activity takes place in: "The Christmas holidays are held in December." "We celebrate Easter in April."

"I normally relax at the weekend." This / Next / Last Day or Month Use "this" or "next" to indicate the nearest future named day or month: "Let's watch the football this / next Monday."
