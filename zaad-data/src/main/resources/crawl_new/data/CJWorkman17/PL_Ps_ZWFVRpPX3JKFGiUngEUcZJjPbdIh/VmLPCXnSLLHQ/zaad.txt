(positive) ?Are you English?? ?Absolutely.? ?Am I ok if I take this?? ?Certainly.? (both mean of course ? positive) Of course not = definitely no / definitely not (negative) No chance ?Have you ever been to prison?? ?Of course not.? (No) ?Have you ever been arrested?? ?No chance.? (Of course not) If you wish to respond in the negative, you must always say ?of course not?. ?Of course? is a positive statement.
