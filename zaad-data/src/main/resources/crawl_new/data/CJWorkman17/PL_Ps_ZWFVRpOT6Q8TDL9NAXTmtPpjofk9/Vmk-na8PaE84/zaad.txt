Most English speakers are not native speakers, but the Internet facilitates communication. 4. English is being combined with other languages on the Internet to create new words and meanings. 5. The Internet is making English even more important -- especially for businesses. 6. Texting has become the first written form of many languages. 7. The Internet is allowing other languages to survive and flourish. 8. Example: Hinglish -- mixture of English, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu. Being taught to British diplomats and recognised by phone companies. 9. The majority of the world's population now speak more than one language. 10.
