Algernon has just asked his good friend Jack to explain why he calls himself Jack in the country but Ernest in London. Jack says it's because he is the guardian of a girl called Cecily, who lives with him in the country. She looks up to him and he feels he should behave well when he's with her, so he pretends he has a younger brother called Ernest so that when he comes up to London, he can enjoy himself. Vocabulary: guardian someone who is legally responsible for someone else, such as a child whose parents cannot look after them (perhaps because they have died) Bunburyist an invented word meaning someone who invents a fictitious person (either themselves or someone else) invalid a person who is ill or disabled and is unable to look after themself invaluable extremely useful or valuable flirts to behave towards someone as if you are romantically or sexually interested in them soir?e a small party in someone's house, usually with music fascinated very interested or attracted inspires makes someone enthusiastic about something destined certain because of fate passionately with great feeling or enthusiasm christened named in a ceremony that usually takes place in a church kneels in a position with one or both knees on the floor Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/...
