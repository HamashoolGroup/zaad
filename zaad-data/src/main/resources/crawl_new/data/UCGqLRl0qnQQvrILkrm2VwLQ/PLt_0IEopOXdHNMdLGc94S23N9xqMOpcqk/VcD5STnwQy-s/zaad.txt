6 Minute Basic Grammar: Have to and must - BBC Learning English
Published on Feb 8, 2016
It's time for 6 Minute Grammar. This week Finn and Alice discuss how we talk about obligations in English using 'have to' and must'. Grammar: If you must do something, it is necessary for you to do it, but this is often your opinion or a rule that you have made yourself. If you have to do something, it is necessary for you to do it. It?s a law, an obligation or a fact. If you don?t have to do something, it isn?t necessary to do it, but you can if you want. If you mustn?t do something, it means ?don?t do it?. It is necessary not to do it.
