Published on Feb 7, 2016
Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/lea... At what age do we become adults? Many people assume it?s 18. It's an age when many leave home for university and also when we can vote in elections the UK. But new guidance for psychologists in the UK says that adolescence - the time when we change from being a child to an adult - now lasts until the age of 25. Does this mean we are growing up later, or are there other factors? Neil and Finn discuss this subject in 6 Minute English and look at some of the language of growing up. Vocabulary: adulthood - the period of life when you are an adult stand on your own two feet - be independent; look after yourself maturity - behaving and thinking like a grown up adolescence - period in your life when you change from being a child to an adult psychologists - person who studies the human mind, their emotions and behaviour hormones - chemicals in the body that influence the development, growth and sex of an animal formative years - period of time when someone develops their character and beliefs social death - embarrassing situation mollycoddling - over protecting or doing too much for someone juvenile - young person but not yet considered an adult Neil: Thank you. We hope you?ve enjoyed today?s programme. Do join us again soon for 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. Goodbye. Finn: Goodbye.
