6 Minute Basic Grammar ? Present continuous and 'going to' - BBC Learning English
Published on Mar 19, 2016
In this session we've looked at the wedding plans of three different couples, and learned how to talk about the future using the present continuous and 'going to'. Now, it's time for 6 Minute Grammar with Rob, Emma and Finn to help us practise the unit's new grammar. Talking about making plans? what is Finn doing tonight? Listen to the programme to find out! Use going to To talk about something we have decided to do in the future, but not arranged yet. I?m going to spend a year travelling. Use the present continuous To talk about something we have decided to do in the future, and made arrangements for. It?s definite, not just an idea. I?m meeting a client at 2pm.
