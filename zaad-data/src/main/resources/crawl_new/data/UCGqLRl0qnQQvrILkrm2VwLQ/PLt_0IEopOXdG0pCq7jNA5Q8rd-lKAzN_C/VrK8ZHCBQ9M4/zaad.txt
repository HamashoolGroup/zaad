We usually say or know when it happened. She called me at the office yesterday. I worked in London in 2010. Steve went to the US three times last year. We often use the past simple in stories, when one thing happens after another in the past. I stopped working in London and I looked for another job. Past simple positive For regular verbs, the past simple ends in -ed. Irregular verbs have a different past form. The past simple form is the same for all persons (I, you, he, she, etc.) I finished university in 2010 and I started a job in a bank. Then he left that job and went to live in Japan. We lived there for a year. Past simple negative We make the negative form with didn?t (did not) + infinitive without ?to?. I didn?t like working in a bank. He didn?t go to the US. He went to Japan. Past simple questions Past simple wh-word questions are made from question word + did + subject + infinitive. Where did you go last night? The question word how is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as size, time, or the price of something. How long did it take to cook dinner? Past simple yes/no questions are made from did + subject + infinitive without ?to?. Did you like living in Japan? What did your children do there? We can use short answers: Did you go to Anjali?s party last night? Yes, I did. / No, I didn?t.
