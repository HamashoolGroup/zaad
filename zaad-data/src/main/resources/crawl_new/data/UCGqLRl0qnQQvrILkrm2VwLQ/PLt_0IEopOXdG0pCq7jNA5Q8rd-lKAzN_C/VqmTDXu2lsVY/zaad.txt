Published on Feb 1, 2016
Here is this week's 6 Minute Vocabulary, all about prefixes. We can put prefixes at the beginning of some words to change their meaning. They are usually only a few letters long like these: un- (unhappy) in- (inexpensive) dis- (disagree) In the show, we hear a man called Dave talking about a meal he ate at a restaurant. But did he enjoy his food? And which prefixes does he use to talk about the experience?
