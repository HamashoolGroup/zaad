Can you see the scary castle? A witch? Oh, look, is that a ghost? No, it's Steve with a white coat on his head! Happy Halloween everyone. In this clip Steve teaches his friend, bob the blob from outer space, a halloween rhyme. It goes like this... Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate. The first one said ''it's getting late.'' The second one said "There are witches in the air.'' And the third one said ''I don't care.'' The fourth one said, ''Let's have some fun.'' The fifth one said, ''Let's run, let's run!'' Woo-oo-oo'' went the wind and out went the light. And five little pumpkins rolled out of sight!
