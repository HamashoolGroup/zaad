Steve walking, skating, skiing, hopping | Story for Kids | English for Children
Published on Jan 21, 2016
Is this a funny story for Children? It?s winter time, but Steve is in a hospital. What happened this time? Oh dear, holiday in the mountains. Steve was walking and he ended under the snow. He was skating, but now his bottom hurts. Is skiing a bad idea? Well, for Steve for sure! There was a ski jump and we can see Steve in a tree. He will have to hop to get to the bathroom. But Maggie will help Steve as usually, she does her Maggie Magic, so we can enjoy all action verbs again and again and stay safe! Learning English with Steve and Maggie is easy and fun!
