Misterduncan On Television In China - 2003
Uploaded on Jul 8, 2007
I was asked to sing during the local English contest prize ceremony. The previous week I had been there in the audience during the final round. My school persuaded me to go out to the front and sing a couple of songs during the break. That evening the local news reported this and showed me performing.I was not very happy about this because I was wearing my "Normal" clothes and looked untidy. However,after that the local government called my school and said they wanted me to sing for the televised prize giving ceremony which would be held the following week. So I dressed up and decided to sing a Chinese song. Following this appearance, many people recognised me in the street. It was a very strange feeling indeed !!
