Learning English - Lesson Seventy Two - English Tense
Published on Apr 26, 2012
In this lesson we will take a look at tense in English. What we did and what we are doing and what we will do. What happened, what is happening and what will happen. All of these sentences involve tense. Thank you to those who pointed out that drank was used incorrectly. Of course informally we often use the word drank to express having drunk something. Often there is a big gap between formal and informal English. A point I make at the end. Those who are native speakers often use informal English.
