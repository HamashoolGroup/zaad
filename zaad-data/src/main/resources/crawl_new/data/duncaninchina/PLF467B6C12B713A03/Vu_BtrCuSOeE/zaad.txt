Learning English-Lesson Ten ( Saying Sorry )
Uploaded on Mar 3, 2009
In this lesson we look at ways to say sorry. You apologise to someone. You offer your apology. You regret your action. You show sympathy. This is the replacement lesson for the original lesson 10, which was about fear. I later remade the fear lesson (Now 32) and this new (saying sorry) lesson fills the space that was left by the original one. 8-))
