Visit us at http://www.letstalk.co.in Effective Time Management At work: One skill that is prevalent in all leaders of repute is time management. People who use these techniques routinely are the highest achievers in all walks of life, from business to sport to public service. Managing time well enables you to be in control of your life; it allows you to act on situations rather than react to situations. When reacting to situations you are ill-prepared and under stress so your action is far from your optimum capacity. Whereas, when you act on situations it is well planned and thus allows you to function at your highest. At the heart of time management is an important shift in focus: Concentrate on results, not on being busy. This is a one of the most important time management skills. Many people spend their days in a frenzy of activity, but achieve very little because they are not concentrating on the right things.
