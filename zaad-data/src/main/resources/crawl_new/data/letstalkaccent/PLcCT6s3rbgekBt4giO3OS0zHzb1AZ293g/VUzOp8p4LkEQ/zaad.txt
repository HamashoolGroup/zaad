Accent Training : Pronunciation of 15 Vowel Sounds Part 02 In this Lesson you will learn how to accurately pronounce all of the main English vowel sounds. The English alphabet has five vowels, a, e, i, o and u, and produce about 15 main vowel sounds. For some English learners this is one of the most difficult part of English to master. Speakers of different languages with less vowel sounds are likely to speak English with only the same number of vowel sounds that are in their native language. Sometimes they don't even know the distinction between these sounds in English. Consequently, non-native speakers might pronounce "fill" and "feel" the same way. Because there is not always a direct relationship between how a word is spelled and how it is pronounced, you should be familiar with the symbols that represent the sounds that you are learning. This way, you will be able to use your dictionary or books when you come across a word that contains a vowel sound that you don't know how to pronounce.
