In today's video, I broke down for you the SAT Vocabulary word, Tumult, to help you memorize it. TUMULT (noun): Uproar, a loud, confused noise, esp. one caused by a large mass of people. The key idea with being able to memorize vocabulary words is the create pictures for those words. The Pictures for this SAT Vocabulary Word is: TUMULT: TOOTH MOWing Definition: Lion's ROARing Then just take both the picture for the word and the picture for the definition and visualize an interaction between the two. That's It! Just review a little bit and you will have these words fully memorized come test day. Remember that the higher the SAT Score you can get when you take it in high school, the better of a chance that you will have at getting accepted into the college or university of your dreams!
