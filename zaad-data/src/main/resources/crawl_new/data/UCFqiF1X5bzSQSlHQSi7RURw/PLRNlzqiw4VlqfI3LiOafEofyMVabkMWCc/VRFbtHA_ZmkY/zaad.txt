Well let me teach you how to never let this happen again. My name is Luis Angel, and I am Your Memory Coach. I teach individuals how to improve their memory through my Better Memory Now Events and Books. I recently released this book called: How to Remember Names and Faces | Master the Art of Memorizing Anyone's Name by Practicing with Over 500 Memory Training Exercises of People's Faces. (http://www.RememberNamesBook.com) In the book you will learn how to easily and quickly use the 3-Step AE Mind Memory System to Memorize Anyone's Name. The system is: 1. Location - What Stands Out About the Individual? 2. Visualize - What Does the Name Remind you of and how can you visualize that on the person's Location? 3. Review - How did you associate the name with the person? I go into much more detail in the book and I will also provide you with over 500 Faces for you to practice with. You will learn how to memorize common first names, foreign names, last names, and even information about individuals. This will help you with your communication skills and social skills to build stronger connections and relationships with the people that you are meeting. The trust level will rise tremendously and they will be more likely to either become a friend and/or do business with you.
