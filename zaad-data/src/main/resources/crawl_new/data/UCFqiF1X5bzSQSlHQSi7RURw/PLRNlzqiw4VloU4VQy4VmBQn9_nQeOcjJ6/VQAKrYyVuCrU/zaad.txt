I gave a Focus and Memory Improvement talk on Valencia High School in the Anaheim School District in Southern California. All of the students loved what I had teach them about memory and focus. Ms. Picht is their teacher and as you saw, also enjoyed the presentation. "My name is Steve Picht and I'm a teacher here at Valencia High School. Luis came and presented to our students today and they were very taken by what he was talking about. All of them could really see how that the memory skills that he was teaching are something that could really help them a lot in their studies. So hopefully we'll have him back. Our students would be interested in applying his techniques, raising their grades, and becoming better students." ================ Remember Names ================ Learn How to Remember Names and Faces Quickly Using the Memorize Anything Technique by going to: http://www.aemind.com/names for the Free Names List!
