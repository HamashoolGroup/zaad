I gave a Focus and Memory Improvement talk on April 12, 2013 at Bell High School in the LA Unified School District. All of the students loved what I had teach them about memory and focus. Ms. Moore is their teacher and as you saw, also enjoyed the presentation. "Hi. I'm Kathleen Moore and I'm an AVID elective teacher here at Bell for the 10th Grade. The students have had many guest speakers but the Memory Project was the most exciting for them. They seemed so engaged and happy and it's something that they could take with them everyday for all of their classes, especially next year. They enjoyed it, it was fun, and it taught them a skill that they really never thought of before." Stay Up!
