This is Luis Angel, your memory coach with AE Mind! I had a chance to interview 2x USA Memory Champ, Nelson Dellis, in regards to the New Competition that he created called the Extreme Memory Tournament. The Basics The Competition will be... two-day event held on April 26th and 27th, 2014 held at the Dart Neuroscience Convention Center in San Diego, CA sponsored by Dart Neuroscience and Washington University in St. Louis (WUSL) offering money prizes from a pool of $60,000 16 of the top mental athletes in the world will be competing to ensure that the competition is at the highest level. The competitors will be split up into 4 groups of 4, mixing the best and worst in each group to maintain fairness. The competition will be run first in group stages (Day 1) and then single-elimination Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Runner-up Match, and Finals (Day 2). All matches will be head-to-head competitive style, with competitors facing each other (1-on-1). All events will be digital. All memorization/recall will occur on a laptop. For XMTs, a laptop may or may not be used (this will be announced prior to the task). Day 1 - Group Stage There will be 4 events throughout the Group Stage matches: 1-Minute Names 1-Minute Numbers 1-Minute Cards 1-Minute Words 3 minute recall time for all events. The top two leaders in each group (by points, or by tie-break percentage if necessary) will advance to Day 2. Day 2 - Single Elimination Stage All matches will be head-to-head, with the competitors facing each other (1-on-1 style). Each match will be a best-of-7 series (first to 4 wins). In addition to the 4 events listed above, there will also be: XMTs (Extreme Memory Tasks) All 4 Quarterfinal matches will begin at the same time so that XMT #1 is revealed and executed at the same time. *All QF matches will execute the same XMT.* Both Semifinals matches will begin at the same time so that XMT #2 is revealed an executed at the same time. *All SF matches will execute the same XMT.* The first match of each match will always start with an XMT. This will decide who gets the first point. The loser of the XMT gets to choose the next event. From there on forward, choice of the next event is given to alternating competitors. The same discipline cannot be chosen twice in a row. Same rules apply for the 4 disciplines as in Day 1, only with some additional tiebreak rules, which are outlined on the event pages. There will be an additional Third-place Match between the losers from the SF round. This match will decide the 3rd and 4th place positions. The Finals will be a best-of-9 series (first to 5 points) to make it as interesting as possible. There will be 2 XMTs in this event. XMT #3 will be to used to decide the first point and will be the same task as the one used for the Third-place Match. XMT #4 will be used to decide who the 4th (total) point.
