I show you here how to turn the Numbers 00-09 into Pictures. I am making this video right now to Show those of you that want to truly improve their memory, focus, and accelerate the rate at which you learn, how to memorize Numbers. I showed you in a previous video how to Use Phonic Sounds from our Body Locations in order to create Pictures for Numbers: http://youtu.be/AlxNBTTgZBg If you don't know what Files are, I'll explain right now. Files are essentially places within your mind in which you can store information on there for easy recall and retrieval later on.: http://youtu.be/585Dm2hhQYU We are going to use the Body files that we created in order to be able to translate a Number into a Picture for easy Memorization and Recall. Remember that you need 5 things in order to memorize anything, Focus, File, Picture, Glue, Review In order to be able to memorize a 100 digit number you need to convert the numbers into pictures. Remember that in the USA and World Memory Championship Competitions you need to be able to Memorize and Recall long strings of numbers so this is a good way to start your Memory Training for the competitions. For the Memory Body Files, We chose 9 spots from your body and 1 from your environment. Here they are (Make sure to visualize these parts with their given number and name. It is very important for future purposes.. Visualization is KEY!): 0 = Sand 1 = Top (For Top of Head) 2 = Nose 3 = Mouth 4 = Ribs 5 = Liver 6 = Joint (For Hip Joint) 7 = Cap (Knee Cap) 8 = Fibula (For Shin Bone) 9 = Ball (For Ball of Foot) I recommend for you to close your eyes and visualize these files in your mind. It helps to sink it deep into your unconscious mind for faster memorization. Now, After you have that Memorized, Let me show you what's the next step. We have to take the Consonant sounds from the First letter of each of the words. Before I do though, Let me tell you that this is essentially like learning a new language. This is the Language of Visual Memory. You will be learning how to Translate Numbers into Vivid Pictures and then Back to numbers. I have studied other ways to memorize numbers, and I feel that this is the best way. It is in my opinion the easiest to learn. Here you go.. Here are the Consonant sounds for each number: 0 = S, Z, C (Soft) 1 = T, D, Th 2 = N 3 = M 4 = R 5 = L 6 = J, Sh, Ch (soft), G (soft) 7 = Ck, K, G (Hard), C (Hard) 8 = F, V 9 = B, P What you have to do next is throw in some vowels when creating a picture for a number. Now here are the Pictures for the Numbers from 00-09: 00 = Sauce 01 = Sod 02 = Sun 03 = Sumo 04 = Sour 05 = Sail 06 = Sash 07 = Sock 08 = Sofa 09 = Soap So that you can learn these pictures faster, create some flash cards.. Place the number on one side and the picture (from Google Images) on the other. Stay Up!
