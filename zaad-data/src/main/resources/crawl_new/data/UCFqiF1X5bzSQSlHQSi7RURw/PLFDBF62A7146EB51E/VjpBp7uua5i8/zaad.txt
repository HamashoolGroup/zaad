I show you here how to Memorize a 20 Digit Number. Make sure to watch the previous videos on Memorizing Numbers to learn how to convert numbers into pictures: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=.... Remember that you need 5 things in order to memorize anything, Focus, File, Picture, Glue, Review In order to be able to memorize a 100 digit number you need to convert the numbers into pictures. Remember that in the USA and World Memory Championship Competitions you need to be able to Memorize and Recall long strings of numbers so this is a good way to start your Memory Training for the competitions. For the Memory Body Files, We chose 9 spots from your body and 1 from your environment. Here they are (Make sure to visualize these parts with their given number and name. It is very important for future purposes.. Visualization is KEY!): 0 = Sand 1 = Top (For Top of Head) 2 = Nose 3 = Mouth 4 = Ribs 5 = Liver 6 = Joint (For Hip Joint) 7 = Cap (Knee Cap) 8 = Fibula (For Shin Bone) 9 = Ball (For Ball of Foot) I recommend for you to close your eyes and visualize these files in your mind. It helps to sink it deep into your unconscious mind for faster memorization. Now, After you have that Memorized, Let me show you what's the next step. We have to take the Consonant sounds from the First letter of each of the words. Before I do though, Let me tell you that this is essentially like learning a new language. This is the Language of Visual Memory. You will be learning how to Translate Numbers into Vivid Pictures and then Back to numbers. I am going to teach you in a way that I learned from 2x USA Memory Champion Ron White's Memory in a Month Program. You can check that out here: http://memoryrw.aemind.com I have studied other ways to memorize numbers, and I feel that this is the best way. It is in my opinion the easiest to learn. Here you go.. Here are the Consonant sounds for each number: 0 = S, Z, C (Soft) 1 = T, D, Th 2 = N 3 = M 4 = R 5 = L 6 = J, Sh, Ch (soft), G (soft) 7 = Ck, K, G (Hard), C (Hard) 8 = F, V 9 = B, P What you have to do next is throw in some vowels when creating a picture for a number. ================ Remember Names ================ Learn How to Remember Names and Faces Quickly Using the Memorize Anything Technique by going to: http://www.aemind.com/names for the Free Names List!
