Luis Angel, your Memory Coach, here to bring you another Memory Improvement video. In today's video, I talk about how running and exercising can increase in size the part of your brain that is essential to memory, called size of your hippocampus. In turn, running can improve your memory. Dr. Majid Fotuhi, PH.D in Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, talks about this in his book, "The Memory Cure." : http://goo.gl/LfYivh He writes: "How Does Physical Activity Lead To Better Memory?" In an article of the June 2002 issue of Trends in Neuroscience, a group of scientists from the University of California reported the possible link between exercise and better memory. They focused their attention on a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. This natural protein improve neuronal health and survival. It makes neurons more resistant to injury caused by a stroke and helps with synthesis of new synapses. Some of the experiments tested mice who exercised and those that didn't. They then saw an improvement in the memory of those mice that ran compared to those that didn't. The scientists also measured the levels of BDNF in the brains of the mice and found that those that exercised and ran, had much higher levels of BDNF than those that didn't run. There were various other examples in the book that show how exercise and running, jogging, or even walking regularly can improve your memory and brain function. So go out and start pumping more oxygen into your body and in turn into your brain so that you can see an improvement in your own memory! I'll see you on the Next Video! Stay Up!
