So today I wanted to talk about how you can start right now to increase your ability to focus, improve your memory, and learn more information much more rapidly. Remember that we have a conscious mind and a subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the most powerful tool that we have. It holds all memory and is responsible for your ability to do automatic actions. This includes breathing and hearing. At the macro level this includes walking and driving. You do these things now without thinking about it. Remember that at one point you didn't know how to walk or drive. You had to consciously be paying attention to everything that was going on while you were learning that new skill. Now that these skills have been ingrained into your subconscious mind, you can not only do them without thinking about it, but you can also do other things such as listen to an audio book while running. You are consciously paying attention to one (learning from the audio book) and subconsciously doing the second activity (running). This is the only time when I would recommend someone to multitask. If you are doing two conscious activities such as texting someone while attempting to listen to your teacher in class, you won't go as much information to stick in you long term memory, because your conscious mind is being divided. Your conscious performs best when it's entire attention is being placed on one task. Remember that as you go about your day today. Pay attention when you are multi-tasking and see how much more information you are able to learn by cutting off of doing two or more conscious mind concentration activities. If you go to school, practice this while doing your homework. I guarantee that you will see yourself getting better grades just by consciously paying attention to one thing at a time. ================ Remember Names ================ Learn How to Remember Names and Faces Quickly Using the Memorize Anything Technique by going to: http://www.aemind.com/names for the Free Names List!
