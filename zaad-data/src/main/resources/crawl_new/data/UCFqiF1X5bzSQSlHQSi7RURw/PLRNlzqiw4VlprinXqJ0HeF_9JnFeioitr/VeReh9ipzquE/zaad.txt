This is Luis Angel, your memory coach with AE Mind! One thing that I have learned through my journey as a student and as a mental athlete, is that the best way to not learn something quickly is to say negative phrases in your mind and have negative beliefs about yourself. All that you are doing is building up a wall which prevents new information and ideas to flow smoothly into your mind. What you want to do instead of having negative thoughts while learning something new, is to say empowering and positive phrases. Things like: "This is Easy" "I Can Learn This" "I am smart." When you do that, You give permission to the new information to come right into your mind so that you learn it faster. Remember! Empowering Thoughts create Positive Results!!
