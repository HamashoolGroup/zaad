This is Luis Angel, your memory coach with AE Mind! I want to show you in this video that you can actually do some memory training when you're out and about. In this case we were at a doctor's skin care office and we numbered 10 different items and pieces of furniture so that we could memorize a few things using those numbered items. By numbering these pieces of furniture, we are creating flies or mental locations. Some mental athletes also call this a journey. Here were the 10 Files that we just created: 1. Fridge 2. Mirror 3. Water Dispenser 4. Couch 5. Marilyn Monroe Picture 6. Counter 7. Computer Monitor 8. Brochure Shelf 9. Magazine Table 10. Trash Can We then take some things to memorize and store them onto these files by visualizing and using a lot of action. Here are the 5 Beach themed things that we memorized: 1. Water 2. Umbrella 3. Skates 4. Surfboard 5. Volleyball So go out there and start doing some memory training everywhere that you go. The more that you practice, the more that you will improve your memory and even your focus all while having fun being creative. I'll see you on the Next Video! Stay Up!
