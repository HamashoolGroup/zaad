Jingle bells lyrics: Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun It is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Ha ha ha Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun It is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Now the ground is white And the night is young Take the sleigh tonight And join us in this song Just get a bob tailed bay Get ready for a run Then hitch him to a sleigh And now we'll have some fun!"
