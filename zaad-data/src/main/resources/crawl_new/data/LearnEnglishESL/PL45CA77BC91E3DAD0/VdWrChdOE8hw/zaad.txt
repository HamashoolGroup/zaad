Best Wishes, Teacher Frank LESSON SCRIPT: ENGLISH GRAMMAR - PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES - LESSON 47b 1 Prepositions And Prepositional Phrases A "preposition" is a word 'placed before' a noun to give more information. (e.g. "on horseback") and often before articles and adjectives in noun phrases (e.g. "on the horse's back".) 2 On the first part of the journey, I was looking at all the life. The three prepositions above (i.e. on, of, at) and their phrases give details and answer WH questions (i.e. when, where, what etc.) 3 There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. These sentences have no prepositional phrases and only give nouns. They lose description. 4 The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds. The above sentence has descriptive detail in two prepositional phrases: "with a buzz" and "with no clouds." 5 The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound. Above, "air" is more fully described by the prepositional phrase "of sound." The prepositional phrase is on the end in the final position where they are often placed. English grammar has no rule limiting the number of phrases on the end of a sentence. 6 I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. Prepositional phrases are mostly on the end of simple sentences, but can be any in beginning or medial position as well. 7 In the desert, you can remember your name 'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. "In the desert" is the only prepositional phrase here. "for" is an old usage and is redundant (i.e. unnecessary.) "to give"is an infinitive verb. 8 la la etc. 9 After two days in the desert sun, my skin began to turn red. Here, there are two prepositional phrases in the beginning of a simple sentence, then S. V. O. (i.e. a subject - verb - object sentence structure.) 10 After three days in the desert sun, I was looking at a river bed. Prepositional phrases can be made up of a number of different words, but they are all structured basically in the same way. 11 And the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead. Example of phrase structure: a preposition - of, plus an article - a. plus an adjective - long, plus a pronoun or noun - river] makes up the phrase "of a long river." 12 You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. 13 In the desert, you can remember your name 'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. 14 la la etc. 15 After nine days, I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea. Here's a phrase in the beginning and end, telling time (i.e. when), object (i.e. what), place (i.e. where) manner (i.e. how) etc. 16 There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. 17 The ocean is a desert with its life underground and a perfect disguise above. Not that of 150 prepositions in the English language, many have two syllables. For example: along among around before beside beyond during toward underneath until within are common etc. 18 Under the cities lies a heart made of ground, but the humans will give no love. Prepositional phrases tell location, time and conditions of events. 19 You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. 20 In the desert, you can remember your name 'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. 21 la... la ...
