A compound sentence has two independent clauses joined by: A. a coordinator (and, nor, but, or, yet, so) B. a logical connector (e.g. however, therefore etc.) C. or a semicolon alone (;) 2 In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand. With an aching' in my heart and my pockets full of sand. The words above are fragments, not sentences. A simple sentence in English grammar requires a verb. Perhaps Waiting in the morning rain." 3 I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so, in the early morning rain, with no place to go. Above in the first 2 lines is a compound sentence with 2 required independent clauses [subject - verb - object] connected by the coordinator "and." 4 Out on runway number nine, the big seven-o-seven's set to go, but I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows. Above is a compound-complex sentence; it has 2 independent clauses and also a dependent clause "where the cold blows." 5 Now the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast. Well, there she goes my friend; well, she's rolling' down at last. What type of sentences are the above? "fast" (adj) means 'to love excitement too much.' Examples: 'living too fast? "He's a fast guy." 6 Hear the mighty engines roar; see the silver bird on high. She's away and westward bound; far above the clouds she'll fly - The first sentence is a compound sentence (command) connected by a semi-colon. The second is a compound - complex sentence because it has a "where" clause on the next slide. 7 where the morning' rain don't fall and the sun always shines. She'll be flying' o'er my home in about three hours time. The last sentence is simple. It has an independent clause: the subject is "She", the verb is "will be" and the indirect object is "home." "over" and "in" begin prepositional phrases. 8 This old airport's got me down; it's no earthly good to me 'cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be. Notice that the "because" clause on the end of this compound- complex sentence. Clauses are often on the end. 9 You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train. So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain. Above, are two simple sentences. How do I know? 10 You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train. So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain. ENGLISH GRAMMAR: LESSON REVIEW Note: The sentence type depends on number and the types of clauses. 1 SIMPLE SENTENCE: Has 1 independent clause (subject, verb, complete thought) 2 COMPOUND SENTENCE: Has 2 independent clauses joined by: A. a coordinator (and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or B. a logical connector (however, therefore, etc.) C. or a semicolon alone (;) 3 COMPLEX SENTENCE: Has 1 dependent clause joined to an independent clause 4 COMPOUND - COMPLEX SENTENCE: Has 2 independent clauses joined to 1 or more dependent clauses OPTIONAL EXERCISE 12 Let's make a new sentence about the story of the song for each of the 4 types of sentences.
