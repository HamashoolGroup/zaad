(Note: As he is traveling by train to Marrakesh, Morocco in Africa, the words heard here are in Arabic.) 3 Looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes. Traveling the train through clear Moroccan skies. 4 Ducks, and pigs, and chickens call. Animal carpet wall to wall. American ladies five-foot tall in blue. 5 Sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind. Had to get away to see what we could find. 6 Hope the days that lie ahead bring us back to where they've led. Listen not to what's been said to you. 7 Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? They're taking me to Marrakesh. 8 All aboard the train. All aboard the train. I've been saving all my money just to take you there. I smell the garden in your hair. 9 Take the train to Casablanca going south; blowing smoke rings from the corners of my my my my my mouth. 10 Colored cottons hang in the air; charming cobras in the square. Striped djellebas we can wear at home. 11 Well, let me hear ya now. Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? They're taking me to Marrakesh. 12 Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? Wouldn't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express? They're taking me to Marrakesh. All aboard the train. All aboard the train. All aboard! ??? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?? ?? hablar Ingl?s comversation ??? ?? ?? n?i ti?ng Anh cu?c tr? chuy?n ?? ?? ?? parler Anglais conversation ????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? falar Ingl?s conversa m?wi?
