Spelling of rhyming word endings vary because of the mixed origins of the words (e.g. French, German, Greek etc. etc.) Examples "Cry", "Tie," "Sigh" and "Guy. 2 I was all right for a while. I could smile for a while. 'aisle' (i.e. noun) has the same end sound as 'ile' in 'smile.' (note: 's' is silent.) 'aisle' is defined as 'a passage between rows of seats, shelves etc.' "The aisle had baby care books." 3 But I saw you last night; you held my hand so tight as you stopped to say hello. 'mite' (i.e. noun) has the same sound as "ight" (above) but is spelled with "ite." So, "mite' and "night" rhyme together. 'mite' means 'a tiny insect found in air, dust etc.' "Mites bite babies often." 4 Oh, you wished me well. You couldn't tell... 'gel' (i.e. noun) has the same long "l" sound as in "well." It's spelled with one 'l'. 'gel' is 'a jelly-like liquid in cosmetics, medicine etc.' "I use shaving gel." Note: Many rhyming words are diphthongs. A diphthong is a gliding monosyllabic speech sound that starts at one vowel and moves to the position of another. Example: "ay" in "play" or "ou" in "out." 5 that I've been crying over you, crying over you. 'due' (i.e. adjective) has the same sound as "ou" in the word "you." It's spelled "ue." 'due' is defined as 'expected at a fixed time.' "The baby is due March 7!" 6 Then you said so long and left me standing all alone, alone and crying, crying, crying, crying. "long" above has no other spelling for the "ong" sound. 'throng' (i.e. noun) is defined as 'a large, packed crowd.' "Ike's wedding attracted a throng of people." 7 It's hard to understand, but the touch of your hand can start me crying. 'bland' rhymes with "hand." The sound "and" has no other spelling. 'bland' (i.e. adjective) means 'lacking strong flavor or seasoning (i.e. of food). 8 I thought that I was over you, but it's true, so true, 'woo' (i.e. verb) has the same "ue" sound and rhymes with "true" but is spelled with "oo." 'woo' means 'to try to win a woman's love.' 9 I love you even more than I did before. 'soar' (i.e. verb) has the same sound as "ore" but has "oar." 'soar' (i.e. verb) means 'to rise quickly above the usual level' "Jim's spirits soared at Marcy's birth. 10 But darling what can I do? For you don't love me, and I'll always be crying over you, crying over you. 'fee' has the same long 'e' sound of "me" but two 'e's. 'fee' is 'a payment made to a professional for services.' "The baby doctor's fees were high." Most rhyming words have a long "e" sound. 11 Yes, now you're gone, and from this moment on, I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying, yeah crying, crying, over you. Above, "gone" (i.e. an "one" and "on" sound) and "on" (i.e. with no 'e') have the same sound, but 'LAN' (i.e. local area network) with "AN" has the same sound.
