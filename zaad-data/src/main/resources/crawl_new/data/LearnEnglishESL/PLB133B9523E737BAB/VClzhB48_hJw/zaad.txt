I remember long ago another starry night like this. In the firelight Fernando, you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar. The word "drums" indicate it is an 18th/19th century war. "Fernando" is Spanish & male. The "o" tells us that he is a man. 4 I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar. They were closer now Fernando. Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally. "Bugle calls" confirm the idea of war and vision of troops "from afar" (but not far away.) 5 I was so afraid Fernando. We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die. And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry. The above shows a young, scared couple in a dangerous conflict. The singer is female. Perhaps it is his wife. 6 There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando. "Stars were bright" may show a dry, clear desert climate as in the US-Mexican War. 7 Though I never thought that we could lose, there's no regret. If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando. If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando. The Mexican freedom fighters "lost" the war (1848) over a Texas-Mexico border conflict. The phrase "never thought that we could lose" indicates this. 8 Now we're old and gray Fernando. Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand. Can you hear the drums Fernando? Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande? Fernando and his wife or female friend came across the border at Rio Grande ("Big River"). 9 I can see it in your eyes. How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land. There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright Fernando. When young, they fought for Mexico to free Texas from the USA and return it to Mexico. 10 They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando. Though I never thought that we could lose, there's no regret. If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando. Texas was won from Mexico 10 years earlier (1836). The Mexicans lost trying to take it back, but have no regrets. 11 There was something in the air that night. The stars were bright Fernando. They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando. The spirit of the Mexicans was enthusiastic, but the US was strong and well equipped.
