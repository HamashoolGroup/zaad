I roller skated to your door at daylight. "roller skated" (v) means 'glide with shoes fitted with four wheels each' "Melanie roller skated to Jack's house in the morning." 3 It almost seems like you're avoiding me. I'm okay alone, but you got something I need. "avoiding" (v) means 'keeping or staying away from' "Jack avoids Melanie and will leave his home when she comes to visit." 4 Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates. You got a brand new key. "brand new" (adj) 'a new product by a popular company' "Melanie bought a brand new pair of pink and white shoe skates." 5 I think that we should get together and try them out to see. I've been looking around awhile. You got something for me. "try them out " The two-word verb 'try out' means 'test something to see if it works well.' "She tried out her skates yesterday." 6 Oh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates. You got a brand new key. 'Skating' is a sport or recreational activity [e.g. 'roller skating', 'roller bladeing,' 'skateboarding', 'ice skating' (gerunds)]. 7 I ride my bike. I roller skate. Don't drive no car. Don't go too fast, but I go pretty far. Here, "pretty" (intensifier) means 'to a fairly high degree or amount' "Melanie said that she has traveled pretty far on her bicycle." 8 For somebody who don't drive, I've been all around the world. Some people say I've done all right for a girl. "done all right for a girl" This common phrase means 'acted well, considering the fact that she is only a young girl'. 9 Oh yeah, yeah! Oh yeah, yeah! Oh yeah, yeah! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! "yeah" (exclamation) is very informal speech for 'yes'. It is a highly used word in songs and informal conversation. 10 I asked your mother if you were at home. She said, yes, but you weren't alone. "not alone" (adv) means 'to be with another person or persons' "Melanie found out that Jack was at home, but he wasn't alone." 11 Oh! Sometimes I think that you're avoiding me. I'm okay alone, but you've got something I need. Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates. You got a brand new key. I think that we should get together and try them out to see. La la la la la la, la la la la la. Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates. You got a brand new key.
