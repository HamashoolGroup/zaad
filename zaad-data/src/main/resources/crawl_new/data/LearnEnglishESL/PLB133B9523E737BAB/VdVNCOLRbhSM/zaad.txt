Teacher Frank VIDEO LESSON TRANSCRIPT ENGLISH CONVERSATION - IDIOMS WITH RAIN 1 Popular Vocabulary And Phrases 2 Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air, and feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way. "flows" (i.e. noun, but usually a verb) means 'a continual movement in a stream (e.g. flow of cash, traffic, etc.)' "Weena has a lovely flow of golden hair." 3 But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone. So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way. "cloud(s)" (n) are a symbol or figure of speech for many things such as 'problems, difficulties. worries, etc.'. "Jay is walking under a dark cloud this week." 4 I've looked at clouds from both sides now, from up and down, and still somehow, it's cloud illusions I recall. I really don't know clouds at all. "illusion(s)" (n) = 'a false understanding; an unreal view.' "Joni sings that she remembers only her illusions about clouds, love and life." 5 Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel, as every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way. "dizzy" (adj) means 'a feeling of spinning around or losing one's balance.' "Marsha felt very dizzy when she was riding the Ferris wheel." 6 But now it's just another show. You leave 'em laughin' when you go. And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away. "you leave them laughing when you go" means 'to end an unpleasant situation with humor or in a pleasant manner (e.g. an engagement.)' 7 I've looked at love from both sides now, from give and take, and still somehow, it's love's illusions I recall. I really don't know love at all. "give and take" (n) means 'the action of giving and receiving in your relationships with people.' "A good marriage needs a lot of give and take." 8 Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud, dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way. "proud" (adj) means 'feeling of pride or satisfaction in your own or anothers achievements.' "Joe is proud to have a lovely new baby daughter." 9 But now old friends are acting strange. They shake their heads; they say I've changed. Well, something's lost, but something's gained in living every day. "changed" (adj) means 'to make or become different [often in a negative way.] "Delores used to trust everyone she met, but now she's changed." 10 I've looked at life from both sides now, from win and lose, and still somehow, it's life's illusions I recall. I really don't know life at all. Above "both sides" (n) means 'two major points of view (e.g. the good and the bad.)' "I can understand both sides of their argument." 11 I've looked at life from both sides now, from up and down, and still somehow, it's life's illusions I recall.
