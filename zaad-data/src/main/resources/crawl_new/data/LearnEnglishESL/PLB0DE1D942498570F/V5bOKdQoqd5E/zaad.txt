Best Wishes, Teacher Frank TRANSCRIPT - ENGLISH LESSON 132 1 A Parody. In a castle in Transylvania in 1818, the Monster meets his bride-to-be. Photos from the movie "Bride of Frankenstein." A "parody" (noun) is an imitation of the style of a writer or an artist, drama etc., for comic effect. 2 I, I love the colorful clothes you wear and the way the sunlight plays upon her hair. The Bride has on a "gown: (i.e. long dress for formal wear). The gray hair isn't from the sun, but from a lightening bolt (i.e. flash of lightening)! 3 I hear the sound of a gentle word on the wind that lifts her perfume through the air. Frankenstein may hear a "gentle" (i.e. mild, kind) word, but in the movie, she let out a loud "shriek" (noun) i.e. a high-pitched cry or sound. 4 I'm picking' up good vibrations. She's giving me excitations. (Repeat again.) The Monster is getting good "vibrations" which means 1. a feeling from something or someone, 'good vibes' 2. a quick back and forth movement. 5 Good, good, good, good vibrations. She's giving me excitations. (Repeat again.) Frankenstein gets good vibes from her, but she receives vibes only from the "laboratory" i.e. a room or building for scientific research. 6 I close my eyes. She's somehow closer now. Softly smile, I know she must be kind. Frankenstein's eyes look closed most of the time. Perhaps, he doesn't like her "wiry hair" i.e. resembling wire in shape and form. 7 When I look in her eyes, she goes with me to a blossom world. A "blossom" is 1. a flower or flowers opening on a tree or bush. 2. a girl's name or term of endearment as honey, darling etc. 8 I'm picking' up good vibrations. She's giving me excitations. (Repeat again.) The Monster may have been excited by his bride-to-be, but she has "rejected", i.e. not accepted, him, the bridegroom. 9 Good, good, good, good vibrations. She's giving me excitations. (Repeat again.) "excite" (verb) which means to cause strong feelings of enthusiasm. Exciting (adjective) describes a person, activity, event, etc. 10 I don't know where, but she sends me there. He or She "sends me" is informal speech meaning to cause one's feelings to be uplifted, soar, go to another place; it's often said about a beloved. 11 Gotta keep those love-good vibrations a-happenin' with her. (Repeat twice again.) Unfortunately, when Frankenstein was rejected, he lost his temper. "Lost his temper" means he could not control his anger and went wild. 12 Ahhhh! Good, good, good, good vibrations. (Repeat last line again.) Na na na na na, na na na. (Repeat three times again.) In the end, the Monster pulled a "lever" i.e. a bar acting as a switch which exploded the castle and killed everyone.
