Learn how to properly use the English verbs ?to say? and ?to tell?. One of the best methods for learning English is watching films. ABA English bases English language learning on short films about real life in Europe and the United States produced exclusively for the American and British Academy. It is a quick and fun way of learning English effortlessly. The ABA Film is the starting point for the unit and contains the communicative functions and grammatical structures which you will learn in the other sections, where you will study the dialogue between the characters in the short film in detail, you will be capable of using all the expressions and including them in your spoken and written English. All the recordings were done with native actors; the scenes occur in both Europe and the United States in order to give a more realistic context.
