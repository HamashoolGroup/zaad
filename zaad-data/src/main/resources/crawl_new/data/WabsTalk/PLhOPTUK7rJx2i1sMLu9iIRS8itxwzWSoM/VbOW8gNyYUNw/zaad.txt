Published on Oct 3, 2015
http://wabstalk.com/ps/ - "It always seems impossible until it's done" - Nelson Mandela. This has to be one of the best speeches in India. Rocky Saggoo (Public Speaking and Super Human Skills Course Trainer at WABS TALK, New Delhi, India) starts talking about Roger Bannister first who ran and made the world record for running 1 mile in less than 4 mins. Rocky then talks about Dashrath Manjhi and Harland Sanders (KFC Founder). Harland Sanders was rejected 1009 times before he tasted success. Rocky advises his students to be 'a bull', and keep hitting the wall of your Public Speaking Fear until it falls.
