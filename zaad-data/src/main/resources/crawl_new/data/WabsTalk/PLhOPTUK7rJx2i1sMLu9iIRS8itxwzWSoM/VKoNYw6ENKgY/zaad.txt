Published on Apr 18, 2013
http://wabstalk.com This video conversation is in UK accent. NITA: Have you watched new video of PSY? AMAR: Are you talking about Gentleman? NITA: Yes. Within days of its launch it got millions of views on You Tube. AMAR: I have watched but I am not much impressed. NITA: But the song is already making waves. I also liked it. AMAR: Actually PSY is riding on the amazing success of Gangnam Style. It made him an international star. He worked day and night on his new album to re-create the magic of last year. But he has failed. Have you not noticed a lot of dislikes he has got for his Gentleman song? NITA: But a large number of people are liking it too. PSY passed though a lot of pressure while making his new album. I agree Gentleman is not very different but it is pleasing to the ears. AMAR: Not much for me. Immense success of Gangnam Style created a lot of expectations in the fans. I regret PSY didn't succeed this time. Though he will get views because the people who watched Gangnam Style will also view Gentleman. But the question is how many people are actually liking the song. NITA: OK. Coming days will tell the real success of this music and dance composition. AMAR: Oh yes. _____________________________________ One of the prominent websites for Learning English online | Spoken English | Communication Skills | English Conversation | English Speaking | Speaking fluently | Grammar skills | Interview Tips | Personality Development | Learn English in Delhi | Vocabulary | Get jobs in multinationals Twitter: http://twitter.com/getsmartenglish Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/SpokenEnglish...
