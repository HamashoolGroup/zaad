http://www.engvid.com/ How do you pronounce duck and education? Is the spelling 'du' in both words pronounced the same? In this video, I will teach you how and when to pronounce 'du' like a 'j' in North American English. We will practice the pronunciation of many words, and we will do some fun tongue-twisters to make sure you've got it. Watch this lesson and make sure you don't make this very common pronunciation mistake again! Don't forget to check out the University of Iowa Library of English site that I mention in this lesson: http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonet...
