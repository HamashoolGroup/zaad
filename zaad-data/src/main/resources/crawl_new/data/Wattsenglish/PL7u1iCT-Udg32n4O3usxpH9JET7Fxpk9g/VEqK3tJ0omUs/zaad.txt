How to play music and do actions in a fully equipped classroom | Learn English Kids
Published on Mar 7, 2016
This video from elementary school ? Grade 2 ? introduces the video song called ?Maggie Magic? in the classroom. It can be used as a very nice and lively warm-up activity in your 45 min class with children aged 7-9. This song teachers and reviews the theme Actions, just like jump, swim, etc. Kids have fun, they learn while moving around and doing the actions. This has been a very good way to switch from their mother tongue into English. The teacher can just monitor the class or is very welcome to join too.
