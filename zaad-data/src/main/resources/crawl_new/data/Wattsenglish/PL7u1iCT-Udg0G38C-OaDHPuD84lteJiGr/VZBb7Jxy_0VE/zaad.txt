Pictures and flashcards are super at introducing new words, but following on from that it is important for the children to keep a clear mental image associated with the new language. In this clip the game 'Invisible Pictures' does just that. More words can be added to suit the ability of the class. Good luck and let us know how this game works for you in your classroom :)
