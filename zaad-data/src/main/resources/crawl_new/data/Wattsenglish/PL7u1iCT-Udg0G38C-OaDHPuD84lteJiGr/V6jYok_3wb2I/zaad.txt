Say Hello Like... | English for Kids | English for Children
Published on Nov 20, 2015
A fun way to push for vocalisation very early on and to build confidence in oral participation, even for the shy/quite children. This activity revolves around just saying 'Hello' but for advanced classes or for a bit of sillyness with teenage classes you can introduce and drill the names of the characters/creatures on the cards. Let us know how this activity works in your classroom :)
