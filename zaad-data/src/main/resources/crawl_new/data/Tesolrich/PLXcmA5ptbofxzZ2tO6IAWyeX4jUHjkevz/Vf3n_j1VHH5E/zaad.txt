Learn Business English - describing trends in a line chart - IELTS -
Published on Apr 9, 2014
Hello Business English learners and students preparing for IELTS, TOEFL or Cambridge BEC exams!! Here is part 2 of a 3-video series on this topic. When you are describing graphs and charts in your power point presentations - or in the writing or speaking parts of exams - you need a range of English expressions, verbs, adverbs and nouns, all with the correct collocation of prepositions. In this series of 3 videos I provide a variety of alternative phrases and sentences which will help you vary your presentation or discussion. This business language to describe your charts accurately is important also to emphasise trends, and make your positive figures sound impressive. In this video I describe the sales numbers and trend of a new product in the first 13 months of sales from launch. Below in the description are a list of words and expressions I use in the presentation, and in the video I give a close-up look at each stage of the sales during the period and the movements that occurred. The language range is important to make your presentation interesting and keep your audience engaged in the content. Thank you for subscribing!
