Learn English - understanding dates - British and American English
Published on Feb 27, 2014
Hi. Here is my short lesson on saying and understanding dates and the difference between British and American English or generally from L2 non-native speakers who use one of two methods to write days and months. It's important to know both methods to avoid confusion, and I give an important tip when writing dates in correspondence. Thanks for watching!
