English Lesson - 8 Latin words or expressions used every day in English you need to know !
Published on Nov 3, 2013
(I have uploaded my own transcript for this video - it can be turned on/off in 'Captions') "per" - "via" - "etcetera" - "vice-versa" - "nota bene" - "exempli gratia" - "id est" - "post scriptum" What are these Latin terms and where do you frequently see them in English, and how are some of them abbreviated? Discover in this tutorial how these expressions have become part of the English language used every day in all forms of written correspondence. All of my students in Italy know these words very well as they very similar in Italian but some are a real surprise!! Some are known only by their abbreviated form, and not all English native speakers know there Latin origins! Learn these English terms and use them in your emails, letters, text messages, business letters and correspondence, and in your spoken English. I hope you enjoy the tutorial.
