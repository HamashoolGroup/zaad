Published on Oct 13, 2013
Do you ever block when you are speaking in English? We can all have communication problems in our own language in some situations, so it is common when speaking in a second language. One factor is the amygdala effect. This is a small area in the brain that responds to danger or fear and becomes the dominant response that blocks you before the rational reaction stored in the brain's memory. This is a short tutorial to introduce this interesting subject that linguistic experts have proven to be a cause in problems when speaking and listening in a second language. http://www.tesol-rich.com for skype lessons with Rich Music written by Tom Cusack http://www.freemusicforvideos.com
