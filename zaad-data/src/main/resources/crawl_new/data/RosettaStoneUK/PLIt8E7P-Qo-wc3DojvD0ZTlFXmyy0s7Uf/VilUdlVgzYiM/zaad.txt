Learn Naturally
Uploaded on Sep 9, 2010
Children learn their first language intuitively through experience with the world around them. Our method mimics this technique by completely immersing you in a language, surrounding you with words, images and sounds on your computer. There is no translation or repetition. By eliminating flash cards, dictionaries, grammar and boring memory tests, our solution empowers you to discover, experience and enjoy your new language to the full. A precisely engineered series of activities helps you engage with images coupled with the voices of native speakers -- encouraging a natural, confident progression from simple words and phrases to whole sentences and complex dialogue. Soon you'll be thinking in a new language.
