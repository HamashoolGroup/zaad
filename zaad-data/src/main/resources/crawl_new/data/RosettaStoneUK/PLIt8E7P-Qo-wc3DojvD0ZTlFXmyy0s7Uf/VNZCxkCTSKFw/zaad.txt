Engage Interactively
Uploaded on Sep 9, 2010
Instant feedback and motivation. Traditional methods of language learning tend to focus on nothing but words, endless lists and repetition exercises. Our solution encourages constant interaction, where you will: * Hear, write and retain knowledge by matching words to images * Complete sentences and phrases out loud * Polish your pronunciation through emulation of native speakers Remember what you've learnt. Our unique Adaptive Recall? feature reinforces your long-term memory by regularly reviewing your progress.
