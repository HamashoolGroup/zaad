VOA?s Deewa Service Musician to Sing Nobel Tribute to Malala
Published on Dec 5, 2014
When the music producer for Voice of America?s Deewa Radio composed his tribute song to Malala Yousafzai, he had no idea he?d be performing it before a worldwide audience two years later. Sardar Ali Takkar will perform "Bibi Sherena" next Wednesday when Malala, the 17-year-old Pakistani women?s rights and education advocate, receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway. She shares the honor with India?s Kailash Satyarthi. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/vo...
