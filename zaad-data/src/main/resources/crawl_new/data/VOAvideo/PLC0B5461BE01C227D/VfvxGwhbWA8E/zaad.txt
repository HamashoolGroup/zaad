Published on May 1, 2015
Nepal is still coming to grips with the full extent of the devastation and misery caused by last Saturday?s magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

Correspondent Steve Herman reports from the Sindhupolchak district, east of Kathmandu, which suffered greatly in Nepal?s worst quake in more than 80 years.
