Uploaded on Nov 25, 2010
Haitian voters go to the polls on Sunday to choose a new president and elect a 99-member lower house and 11 members of the 30-seat Senate. The election is going forward despite the cholera epidemic now plaguing the nation and the lingering effects from the earthquake that devastated the country last January.
