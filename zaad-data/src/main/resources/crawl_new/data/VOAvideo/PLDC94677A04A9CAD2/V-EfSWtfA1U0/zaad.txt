Replica of Prehistoric Cave Opens in France
Published on Apr 27, 2015
A detailed copy of a cave containing the oldest figurative drawings made by Europe?s prehistoric inhabitants opened over the weekend (4/25/15) in France, not far from the original cave. The replica was built because the original drawings are too fragile to be exposed for public viewing. VOA?s George Putic reports. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/re...
