James Webb Space Telescope Progresses Toward Launch
Published on Apr 20, 2015
This week (April 24, 2015) marks the 25th anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope. While it continues to capture data and images, its successor is on its way. The James Webb Space Telescope -- named for the man who ran NASA in the 1960's -- is currently being assembled and tested prior to its launch in 2018. As VOA?s Rosanne Skirble reports, the $8-billion observatory is designed to expand on knowledge from Hubble and new giant ground-based telescopes.
