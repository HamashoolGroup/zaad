Sonar Device Scours Java Sea for Lost AirAsia Plane
Published on Jan 5, 2015
Several large pieces of debris have been found in the Java Sea and could prove to be parts of AirAsia flight 8501. The plane and the 162 people on board disappeared from radar over the region more than a week ago. The U.S. military sent a second ship with special sonar devices to help search for the missing airliner. VOA?s Carolyn Presutti shows us how the search equipment is being used.
