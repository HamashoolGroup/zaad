Fast Track Trade Bill Opens Economic, Political Divisions
Published on Apr 17, 2015
U.S. lawmakers agreed on draft legislation this week to give the White House ?fast track? authority to negotiate a free trade deal with Pacific nations. If approved, the bill gives lawmakers the authority to set trade objectives, but limits their ability to make changes once agreement is reached. Trade officials say the bill would help President Barack Obama realize his so called ?Asia pivot,? but as Mil Arcega reports, it also sets the stage for economic and political divisions at home.
