Fast Food Workers Demand Sustainable Wage, End to Exploitation
Published on Dec 4, 2014
American fast food workers and their supporters are demonstrating to demand a higher minimum wage and other labor rights. Under a banner organization called "Fight for 15," the protests are expected to eventually take place around the country, as workers of various professions seek a $15 minimum wage per hour, up from the current $7.25 set by the federal government, although most states have established their own minimums.
