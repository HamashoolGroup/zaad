New York Yankees Compete in World Series
Uploaded on Nov 2, 2009
The New York Yankees are America's World Series again this year. It is one of two professional baseball teams in the country's largest city. The players who wear the Yankee's famous "pinstripes" are part of a winning tradition that dates back more than 100 years. The team leads Major League Baseball in revenue and in championships.
