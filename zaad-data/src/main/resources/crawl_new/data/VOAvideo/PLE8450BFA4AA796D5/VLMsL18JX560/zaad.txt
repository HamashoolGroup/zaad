All Is Quiet At Olympics Protest Park
Uploaded on Aug 15, 2008
Since the start of the Olympics a few protests have occurred in Beijing but they were quickly halted by Chinese security forces. Seven Americans and a Japanese national were detained after protesting against China's policy on Tibet near the main Olympics venue.

Beijing has designated three parks for protests during the Olympics, but so far no demonstrations have taken place in these designated areas. VOA's Brian Padden reports from Beijing.
