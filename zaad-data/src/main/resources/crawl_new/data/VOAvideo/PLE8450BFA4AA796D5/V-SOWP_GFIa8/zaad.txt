Swedish Musician Composes Olympic Overture
Uploaded on Aug 7, 2008
To set the mood for the pageantry of the Olympic Games in Beijing, the Chinese Olympic Committee held a competition for the official musical overture. Over 100 musicians from around the world participated. The winner, Robert Wells, is an accomplished musician from Sweden. But as VOA's Brian Padden reports from Beijing, Wells says what the organizers like about his overture is the mix of easy melody, and rock and roll with a Chinese touch.
