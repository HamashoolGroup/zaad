Gun Owners Rally in Support of Gun Rights
Uploaded on Apr 20, 2010
Some came to the Washington area Monday to take out their guns in a show of support for gun rights. Others came for a rally in the shadow of the Washington monument "to support the right to keep and bear arms" and to protect the Second Amendment. They chose Monday since it is the anniversary of the 1775 battles that started America's Revolutionary War. VOA's Carolyn Presutti explains the issue of gun rights and then takes us to the rallies.
