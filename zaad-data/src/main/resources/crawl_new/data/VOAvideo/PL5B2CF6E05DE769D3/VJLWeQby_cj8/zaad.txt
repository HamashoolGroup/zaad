Climate Change Today's Reality in New Films
Uploaded on Apr 30, 2010
Our planet is warming. Average global temperatures have climbed about 1 degree Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century, rising at an accelerated rate in recent decades. Scientists believe the global warming trend is responsible for an increased severity of droughts, floods, and storms across the globe, and slowly rising ocean levels. The serious consequences of Earth's changing climate are the subject of three new documentary films, funded in part by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. As VOA's Rosanne Skirble reports, the films take us to the front lines of climate change in Papua New Guinea, East Africa and Bangladesh.
