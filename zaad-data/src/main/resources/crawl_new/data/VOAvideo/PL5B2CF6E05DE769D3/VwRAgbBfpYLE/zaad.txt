Russian Adoption Scandal Shocks US Parents
Uploaded on Apr 23, 2010
After an American mother sent her 7-year-old adopted son back to Russia, Moscow said it was suspending adoptions to US families. A high level delegation from the U.S. State Department is scheduled to meet with Russian officials in Moscow on April 29 and 30. The officials will talk about how to better protect children and all parties involved in international adoptions. For the moment though, many American families who have applied to adopt a Russian child worry about whether their adoption process will continue. VOA's Elizabeth Lee has more details on the obstacles in U.S.-Russian adoptions and what adoptive parents are saying about them.
