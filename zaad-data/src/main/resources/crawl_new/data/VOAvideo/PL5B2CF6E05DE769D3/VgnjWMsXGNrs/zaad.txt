Hezbollah Museum Opens in Southern Lebanon
Uploaded on Aug 30, 2010
A new tourist attraction in southern Lebanon is causing controversy. It's dedicated to the political party and Shi'ite militia Hezbollah, which controls large swaths of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006, firing deadly rockets at Israeli towns and cities. The museum opened three months ago and already has attracted more than 300,000 visitors. Some critics, though, say it's pure propaganda.
