Despite Controversy, Business Owner Continues Sale of Confederate Flags
Published on Jul 30, 2015
At Cooter?s, a store in rural Sperryville, Virginia, about 120 kilometers west of Washington, D.C., Confederate flags are flying off the shelves. The red, white and blue battle flag, with 13 white stars representing the Confederate states, was carried by southern forces during the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s. The South had seceded from the Union over several key issues of disagreement, including slavery. VOA?s Deborah Block has the story. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/de...
