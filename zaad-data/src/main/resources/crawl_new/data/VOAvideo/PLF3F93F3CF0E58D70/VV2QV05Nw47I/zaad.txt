Baltimore Protesters Demand Police Accountability, Justice
Published on Apr 24, 2015
Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Baltimore, (in the eastern U.S. state of) Maryland Thursday to again demand changes to the justice system following the death of a 25-year-old man taken into police custody last week. Officials arrested two people for disorderly conduct in what was otherwise a loud but peaceful protest as the city awaits more information from authorities about how Freddie Gray died. VOA's Victoria Macchi has more from the rally. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/ba...
