Published on May 4, 2015
FBI agents continue to investigate the two men who opened fire outside a free speech event Sunday in Garland, Texas, before being shot to death by a police officer on the scene. The shooting took place outside an auditorium where a group that is considered anti-Islam held a contest for the best depiction of the Prophet Mohammad, the physical representation of whom is considered blasphemous by devout Muslims. VOA's Greg Flakus has more on the story from Houston. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/27...
