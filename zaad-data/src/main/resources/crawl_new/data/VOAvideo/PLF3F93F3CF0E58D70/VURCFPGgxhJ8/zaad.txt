Boy Scouts of America Lifts Ban on Gay Leaders
Published on Jul 28, 2015
The Boy Scouts of America has lifted its ban on openly gay adult leaders and employees, but local Boy Scout units chartered by religious organizations still will be permitted to exclude gay adults from serving as unit leaders, scoutmasters or camp counselors. About two-thirds of the 100,000-plus Boy Scout units nationwide are linked to religious institutions. The rest are chartered to civic groups and educational organizations. Zlatica Hoke reports.
