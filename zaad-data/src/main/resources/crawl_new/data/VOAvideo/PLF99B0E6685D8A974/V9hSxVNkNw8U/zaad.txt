Clashes in Burundi Claim New Victims
Published on May 7, 2015
Clashes in Burundi have claimed new victims as the opponents of President Pierre Nkurunziza continue to protest his decision to seek a third term in office. The opposition says the president's plan violates the country's constitution, which allows only two terms. The unrest is the worst in Burundi since a civil war that ended in 2005. Zlatica Hoke reports the violence has sent waves of refugees into neighboring countries. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/27...
