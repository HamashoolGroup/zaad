Beatrice Yardolo was to make history as Liberia?s last Ebola patient. Liberians recently started counting down 42 days, the period that has to go by without a single new infection until the World Health Organization can declare a country Ebola-free. That countdown stopped on March 20 when there was another new case of Ebola, making Yardolo?s story a reminder that Ebola is far from over. Benno Muchler reports from Monrovia.
