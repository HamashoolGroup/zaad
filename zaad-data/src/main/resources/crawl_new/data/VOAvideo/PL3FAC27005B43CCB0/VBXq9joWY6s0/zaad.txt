Sidemen to Famous Blues Artists Record Their Own CD
Published on Apr 15, 2015
Legendary blues singer BB King was briefly hospitalized last week and the 87-year-old ?King of the Blues? may not be touring much anymore. But some of the musicians who have played with him and other blues legends have now released their own CD in an attempt to pass the torch to younger fans... and put their own talents out front as well. VOA?s Greg Flakus has followed this project over the past year and filed this report from Houston. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/27...
