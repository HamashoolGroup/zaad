'The Interview' Screened in Movie Theaters
Published on Dec 25, 2014
Movie theaters across the United States have begun screening "The Interview," the much-hyped Sony Pictures film. Amid threats of cyber warfare and violence, American theaters shied away from showing the comedy and Sony canceled the film's release. But following criticism, Sony backtracked from that decision, and on Christmas Day, some smaller theaters screened the film to sellout audiences. Arash Arabasadi visited one theater in Washington and files this report. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/25...
