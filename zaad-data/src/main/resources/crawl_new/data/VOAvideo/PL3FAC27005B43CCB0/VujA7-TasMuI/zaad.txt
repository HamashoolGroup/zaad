Haunted House Attraction in Virginia Brings Out Screams
Published on Oct 27, 2014
October 31 is Halloween - a day when the souls of the dead are said to walk the earth. Festive activities include costumed children going door to door trick or treating for candy, costume parties and haunted house attractions, like a mansion in Leesburg, Virginia. Located on Paxton Campus, which has programs to help needy children and their families, the haunted house is a fund raiser that brings in thousands of visitors each year. We?ll warn you that even though some of the things in the mansion look real, none of them are. Join VOA?s Deborah Block - if you dare - on a tour of the ghoulish house.
