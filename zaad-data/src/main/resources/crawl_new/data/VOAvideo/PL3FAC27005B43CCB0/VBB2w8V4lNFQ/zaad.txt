Navajo Jewelry Shines in New York City
Published on Dec 3, 2014
Turquoise, coral, opal and silver are tools in the hands of master Navajo jewelers.

VOA's Daniela Schrier gives us a look at the exhibition, which comes as President Obama opens the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Conference in Washington.
