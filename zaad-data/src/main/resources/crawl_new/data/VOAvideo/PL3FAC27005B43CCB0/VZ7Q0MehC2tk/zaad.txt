Cambodian American Hip Hop Artist Sings of Personal Struggles
Published on Aug 21, 2014
A growing underground movement of Cambodian American hip hop artists is rapping about the struggles of living in urban America. Most, if not all of them, are refugees or children of refugees who came to the United States from Cambodia to escape the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s. Through their music, the artists hope to give voice to immigrants who have been struggling quietly for years. Elizabeth Lee reports from Long Beach, California, home to the largest Cambodian community outside that country. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/24...
