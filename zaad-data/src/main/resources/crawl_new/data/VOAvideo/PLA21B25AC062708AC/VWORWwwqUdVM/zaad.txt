Flushing, New York, is Proud of Its Religious Diversity
Uploaded on Jul 15, 2008
The neighborhood of Flushing in New York City's borough of Queens, just outside Manhattan, has been a model for religious freedom since the 1600s. Back then, members of The Society of Friends, or Quakers, began arriving in what was then a Dutch colony, fleeing religious persecution in England. The colony's director-general barred the Friends from practicing their religion. In protest, the citizens of Flushing wrote a document called "The Flushing Remonstrance." The document pleaded with the governor to grant the Quakers the right to worship. Eventually, they succeeded, and today Flushing is home to more than 200 places of worship.
