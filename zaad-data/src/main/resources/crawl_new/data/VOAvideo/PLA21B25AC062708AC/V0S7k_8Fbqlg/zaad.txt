French President Calls Burqa Ban A Moral Choice
Uploaded on May 20, 2010
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his cabinet have discussed a draft bill aiming to ban the full-face Islamic veil in France. If the bill becomes law, a woman wearing full Islamic coverings such as a burqa or niqab in public places will be fined 150 euros (about 185 dollars). A top judicial body has warned that the ban could be unconstitutional. Mariama Diallo reports that experts say the controversy is a symbol of the broader tensions between Europe and its Muslims.
