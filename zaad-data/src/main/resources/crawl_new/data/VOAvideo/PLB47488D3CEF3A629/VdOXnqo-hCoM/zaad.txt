Definition of a ?Great? President
Published on Nov 25, 2014
Carol Castiel and VOA White House Correspondent, Aru Pande, speak with Aaron Miller, Distinguished Scholar at The Woodrow Wilson International Center about his new book, The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President. Miller delineates the many factors including a polarized Congress, a relentless 24-hour news cycle and the nature of crises as reasons why America will not see the likes of another George Washington, Abraham Lincoln or FDR, whom Miller classifies as ?great.? Miller calls President Barack Obama a ?historic? president but also says he is the ?disappointer-in-chief? because Obama has not managed to deliver on the high expectations he generated among his supporters.
