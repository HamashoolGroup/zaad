Research Group Has High Hopes for New TB Vaccine
Uploaded on Sep 26, 2011
Physicians have long known that the so-called "BCG" vaccine for tuberculosis does not provide the same level of protection against the disease in all parts of the world. Some also say the vaccine's effectiveness has been declining since its development in the 1920s, and that it protects against only certain kinds of TB infections. Now, a non-profit health organization says a new gene-based vaccine it's developing has shown promise as a better source of immunity against tuberculosis, a disease that kills nearly two million people every year.
