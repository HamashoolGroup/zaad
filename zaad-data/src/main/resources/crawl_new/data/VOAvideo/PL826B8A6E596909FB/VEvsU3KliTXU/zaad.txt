Christian Iraqis Find Refuge in Jordanian Church
Published on Oct 27, 2014
More than 3,000 Iraqi Christians have sought refuge from the fighting in their country in churches in Jordan. And Caritas, an aid group affiliated with the Catholic Church says it expects more than 1,000 more to arrive in the coming days. Unlike the Muslim refugees who have taken shelter in UN-organized camps around the country, the Christians have sought safe haven among membersof their faith. VOA's Tala Hadavi caught up with a group from Qaraqosh and Mosul who were some of the last Christians to leave an area known for being the home of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.
