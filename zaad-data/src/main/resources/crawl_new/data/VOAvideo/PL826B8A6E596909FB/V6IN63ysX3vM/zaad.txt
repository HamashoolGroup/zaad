Syrian Refugees Complain About Conditions at Jordanian Camp
Published on Nov 12, 2014
The number of Syrians able to flee the chaos at home has dropped dramatically, according to a report that says neighboring countries are stopping refugees at the border. The International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council place blame in part on the international community, saying it has failed refugee host countries, now overburdened caring for those who have already fled. Jordan has 620,000 registered Syrian refugees, straining resources in urban areas where the vast majority have relocated. To relieve some of the pressure, officials opened another camp, Azraq, six months ago aiming to house 130,000 people. So far, just 15,000 refugees have moved in. Tala Hadavi recently visited the camp and has this report. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/25...
