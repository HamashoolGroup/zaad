Website: http://www.martialartexchange.com/ MAX and inlingua Vancouver present: Due to the great expansion of Jiu-Jitsu, this gentle art has opened several job opportunities anywhere in the world for athletes and practitioners. There is a very large demand for instructors who are able to teach Jiu-Jitsu in English: the United States, Canada, Europe and even Arab countries where English is not the first language, it is still a fundamental requirement. With this in mind, M.A.X has partnered with Inlingua - one of the most respected English schools in Canada, and created a special course for the gentle art education in English. It is an intensive course that lasts one month. It consists of lectures in the classroom (4 hrs. per day) and practical lessons as an assistant (2 hrs. per day) which will be given in one of the greatest Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu schools worldwide. Altogether, this is 6 hours of lessons per day. By the end of the course, Inlingua and Martial Art Exchange will grant a diploma of completion of the Advanced/Technical - IP1with a workload of 120 hours. Having this diploma will enable you to give Jiu-Jitsu lessons in English, and we will prepare you to enter the job market. Fore more info: http://www.martialartexchange.com/pro...
