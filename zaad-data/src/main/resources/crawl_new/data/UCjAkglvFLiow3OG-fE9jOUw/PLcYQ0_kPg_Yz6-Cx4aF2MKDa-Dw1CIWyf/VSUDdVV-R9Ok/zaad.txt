Double Negative - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Mar 19, 2015
Today we are going to look at a common grammatical error: double negative. A double negative occurs when 2 negative words are used in the same sentence, which produces an affirmative sense. Consider the following: "John Snow doesn't know nothing." "Doesn't" and "nothing" cancel each other out in this case and the sentence carries the same meaning as "John Snow knows something." However, that is almost certainly not what the speaker intended to say. To avoid confusion, always remember to use only ONE negative word in a sentence to convey negation. ___ Connect with us!
