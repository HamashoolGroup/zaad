Present Simple - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Feb 19, 2015
English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver: Present Simple Tense Present Simple is the most basic tense in English. We use the present simple tense in many ways. After introducing you to the structure, this video will look at habit, routine, instructions, fixed arrangements, emotion, opinions and senses. I find this sentence a bit confusing. Can you rephrase it to explain your thoughts better? The present tense is the base form of the verb: I work in London. But the third person (she/he/it) adds an -s : She works in London. I like apples. Are you serious about the ?apples? as an example to this?? Did you mean to say ?She likes apples.?? Connect with us!
