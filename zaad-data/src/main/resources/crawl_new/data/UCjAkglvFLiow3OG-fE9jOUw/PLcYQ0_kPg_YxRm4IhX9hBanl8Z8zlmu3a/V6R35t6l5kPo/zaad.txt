Its vs It's - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Apr 7, 2015
--- VIDEO TITLE: Its vs It's - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: it?s ? this can mean only two things: ?it is? and ?it has 1. It's a very happy puppy. 2. The dog is very cute. It's a short tail. its ? this can mean only one thing: possessive ? something which indicates belonging to. 1. The cat is playing with its toy. English learners and native English speakers alike get confuse because we assume that we must have an apostrophe (') when talking of something belonging to someone or something. However, this is not always true. It is when talking about names of things that we add an apostrophe: 1. Jimmy's car. However, the word ?its? belongs in the grammatical group of words: my, your, his/her/its, our, your, their. As you can see, these words do not use an apostrophe, but they are still possessives.
