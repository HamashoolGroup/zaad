Comparative and Superlative with Tash Comparing two or more things to each other using adjectives. Adjectives are words that describe or modify another person or thing in the sentence. Form the comparative and superlative forms of a one-syllable adjective by adding ?er for the comparative form and ?est for the superlative. If the one-syllable adjective ends with an e, just add ?r for the comparative form and ?st for the superlative form. If the one-syllable adjective ends with a single consonant with a vowel before it, double the consonant and add ?er for the comparative form; and double the consonant and add ?est for the superlative form. With most two-syllable adjectives, you form the comparative with more and the superlative with most. If the two-syllable adjectives ends with ?y, change the y to i and add ?er for the comparative form. For the superlative form change the y to i and add ?est.Two-syllable adjectives ending in ?er, -le, or ?ow take ?er and ?est to form the comparative and superlative forms. For adjectives with three syllables or more, you form the comparative with more and the superlative with most. Connect with us!
