--- VIDEO TITLE: Plural Possessives - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Plural Possessives When showing possession of a plural noun, simply add an apostrophe ( ?) at the end end of the word. However for plural nouns that have a different form like the plural noun ?children? you add an apostrophe ?s? to the end of the word. Example: The brothers? bike. If the noun is singular add an apostrophe (?) and the letter ?s? at the end of the word. Example: The cat?s toy. --- TEACHER: Linda Connect with us!
