--- VIDEO TITLE: English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver: ED Pronunciation with teacher Linda --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Pronouncing ?ed? ending ?ed? endings may be pronounced in one of the following three ways in English: 1)/ t / 2) /id/ 3) /d / Like many rules in English there are exceptions. There are several exceptions to the rules. Each of the following words do not follow the ?ed? ending rules. For these words, the ?ed? ending is pronounced like ?id?. aged blessed crooked dogged learned naked ragged wicked wretched There is the rule, with the explanation using the term voiced(vocal cords vibrate). and unvoiced(no vibration of the vocal cords) sounds. However in this video it does not use the term voiced or unvoiced, instead you will see what exactly these sounds are. In other words in this video you will see an alternative way to learn this rule. Nevertheless the two teaching techniques apply to the same concept which is that the determining factor of pronouncing ?ed? endings is the sound of the end of the word not the letters. 1. ?ed? endings are pronounced ?t? if the end of the word sounds like: K, S, Ch, Sh, F, P, Th 2. ?ed? endings are pronounced ?id? if the end of the word sounds like: T or D 3. ?ed? endings are pronounced ?d? for all other ending sounds: A, B, E, G, H, I , J, L, M, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z Connect with us!
