It can also be used to show that something is not happening now. In English, "now" can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on. Sometimes, we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second. Sometimes, speakers use the Present Continuous to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future. The Present Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. 'He's always arriving late'. Notice that the meaning is like Simple Present, but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing." Connect with us!
