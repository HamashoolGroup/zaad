--- VIDEO TITLE: English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver: The difference between See, Look at and Watch with Linda --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Do you know the difference between See, Look at and Watch? The three are very similar because all three talk about different ways of using your eyes. However there are 2 very important differences. 1. Inactive and active words 2. Duration of time See is an inactive word which means that when your eyes are open, you do it without thinking. Example- When I wake up in the morning I see my desk. Look at is an active word which means that you want to do it . But it is for a short time. Example- Look at that awesome car! Watch is also an active word. You must want to do it but it is for a longer period of time. Example-Let's watch the hockey game. Connect with us!
