--- VIDEO TITLE: However and Nevertheless - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Nevertheless and however Nevertheless and however are words that let us know about a cause, and a contrasting consequence. Simply put, they do the same job as the word 'but', and are used when the contrasting result needs to be emphasized. It is a good idea to try to vary the ways you can express the idea of 'but', especially when writing. Nevertheless and however are two of the different ways to do this. This video explains how to use them, as well as the difference between the two words. Connect with us!
