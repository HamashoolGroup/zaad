--- VIDEO TITLE: Active and Passive voices - English lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Active and Passive voices - English lessons with inlingua Vancouver Passive voice: The lightsaber was broken Active voice: I broke the lightsaber. Passive voice: Cigarette taxes will be raised. Active voice: Congress will raise taxes on cigarettes. Passive voice: My nose was punched by you! Active voice: You punched me in the nose! Passive voice: The base was attacked and some rebels were killed. Then the attack was repelled. Rey was taken and hope was lost. Active voice: Stormtroopers attacked the rebel base. The the Resistence arrived. Kylo Ren took Rey and Finn lost hope. The passive voice is better in these cases: The doer is unknown/unimportant: School was cancelled! You want to be polite: Your application was rejected. You want to emphasize the thing: The trophy will be given to the winner. You are writing impersonally or scientifically: The mice were separated into two groups. --- TEACHER: TASH Connect with us!
