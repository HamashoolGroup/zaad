--- VIDEO TITLE: Present Perfect - For and Since - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Present Perfect - For Since- Using the present perfect, we can define a period of time before now by considering its duration, with for + a period of time, or by identifying its starting point, with since + a point in time. FOR and SINCE can also both be used with the past perfect. SINCE can only be used with perfect tenses. FOR can also be used with the simple past. Connect with us!
