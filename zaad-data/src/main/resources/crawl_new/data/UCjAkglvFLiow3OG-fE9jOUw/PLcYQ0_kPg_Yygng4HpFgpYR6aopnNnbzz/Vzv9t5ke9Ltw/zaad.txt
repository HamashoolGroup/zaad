--- VIDEO TITLE: English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver: Past Continuous When and While with Teacher Tash --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Past Continuous - When While- Use the Past Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past was interrupted. The interruption is usually a shorter action in the Simple Past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time. Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when she called" or "when it bit me." Other clauses begin with "while" such as "while she was sleeping" and "while he was surfing." When you talk about things in the past, "when" is most often followed by the Past Simple verb tense, "while" is usually followed by the Past Continuous. "While" expresses the idea of "during that time." Connect with us! Email: info@inlinguavancouver.com Twitter - https://twitter.com/inlinguaVan Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/inlinguaVanc...
