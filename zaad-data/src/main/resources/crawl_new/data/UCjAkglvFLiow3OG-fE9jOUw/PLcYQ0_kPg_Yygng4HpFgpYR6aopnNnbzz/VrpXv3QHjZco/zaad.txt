--- VIDEO TITLE: Adverbs of Manner - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver with Teacher Tash. --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Adverbs of Manner- How did you do that? Did you do it well? Adverbs of manner describe how something happens. We add in an adverb of manner after the verb in a sentence with no object, for example ?I speak quickly?. That ?ly? ending is how we form the majority of adverbs but there are some irregular ones that can?t take an ?ly? ending. ?Good? becomes ?well? for example. Check out this video for some help forming sentences using adverbs of manner. Connect with us!
