---PREVIOUS VIDEOS: Have or Get Something done - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ew5P... --- VIDEO TITLE: Passive Voice - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Passive Voice One of the two ?voices? of verbs (the other is active voice). A verb is in the passive voice when the subject of the sentence is acted on by the verb. We usually use the passive voice where the person/thing doing the action is unknown or unimportant. For example ?The building was built in 1940? we don?t know WHO built the building, or we don?t care, so we have used passive voice. Passive voice is constructed using the verb ?be? in the correct tense, combined with the past participle. Subject + be + main verb past participle (+by + agent) ? it is not necessary to include the agent, but it is possible. Note : It is usually preferable to use the active voice whereverpossible, because it gives a sense of immediacy to the sentence. --- TEACHER: Tash Connect with us!
