--- VIDEO TITLE: Gerunds - English lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Gerunds - English lessons with inlingua Vancouver If you add -ing on the end of a verb, you can turn the verb into a noun. That noun is called a gerund. I run (verb). Running (noun/gerund) is fun. I eat (verb). Eating (noun/gerund) is more fun than running (noun/gerund). Possessive nouns/pronouns are ussually used with gerunds. Wrong: Mom doesn't like me eating too much icecream. Right: Mom doesn't like my eating too much icecream. Wrong: Josh smacking his chewing gum is driving me crazy. Right: Josh's smacking his chewing gum is driving me crazy. If the emphasis is on the action always use the possessive case. I hope you don't mind my eating this apple. But! If you want to strongly emphasise the doer of the action, you have the option of the objective case. I hope you don't mind me holding your hand. --- TEACHER: TASH Connect with us!
