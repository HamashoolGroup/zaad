Remember vs. Remind | Like A Native Speaker
Published on Nov 13, 2014
In Canada it was Remembrance Day this week, and Veteran's Day in the United States. This is a serious day for North Americans where we remember the soldiers and heroes who fought for us. In Canada we wear poppies to remind us of the sacrifices they have made. In this lesson, I'll show you how to correctly use 'remember' and 'remind'.
