Most people think of pronunciation as a mental skill, like vocabulary or grammar. But it's more like a physical skill, like soccer or dancing. You can immediately remember a vocabulary word, but you can't immediately be good at soccer. Repeated conscious practice is the only way to improve!

Ian is an expert in pronunciation and the history of English.
