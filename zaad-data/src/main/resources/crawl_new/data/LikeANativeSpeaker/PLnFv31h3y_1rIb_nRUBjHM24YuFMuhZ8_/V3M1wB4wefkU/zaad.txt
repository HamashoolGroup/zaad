Canadian Spelling | Like A Native Speaker
Published on Apr 24, 2014
You asked for it! A long time ago I made a video talking about the differences between American and British spelling in English and since then I've had several people ask me for a video about Canadian spelling. The short version is, Canada is awesome. The long version is, that Canada uses mostly British style spelling but is generally very comfortable with American style and that both are generally OK. Ian Schellenberg is an English teacher and teacher trainer in Vancouver, Canada with a passion for languages. He enjoys learning and teaching all of the fine nuances of any language.
