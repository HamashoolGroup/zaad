Been And Gone With The Present Perfect | Like A Native Speaker
Published on Sep 18, 2014
Using be and go with the present perfect tense can be tricky, especially because the usage is actually different depending on the country. British English uses gone in a different way than American and Canadian English, and the pronunciation of been varies with nation as well! Ian Schellenberg is an English teacher and teacher trainer in Vancouver, Canada with a passion for languages. He enjoys learning and teaching all of the fine nuances of any language. Ian is an expert in pronunciation and the history of English. SUBSCRIBE http://bit.ly/143yXED Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/LikeAN...
