First Portuguese conversation | Learning Portuguese in one month
Published on Jul 22, 2013
This is my first unscripted conversation with a native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese. This was extremely difficult but also really educational. I even slipped a bit of Japanese in there out of habit. I'm very glad I made this video and watch out next week for the next one!
