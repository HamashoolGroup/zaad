How to make brigadeiro in Portuguese | Portuguese one month challenge
Published on Jul 29, 2013
It's near the end of July and that means nearing the end of my language hacking challenge. Thank you so much for your kind words and support! I have tried to learn as much as I can in one month (with no formal classes or teaching). It's been an amazing ride. I intend to continue studying Portuguese because I feel I've just gotten to beginner level. Fear not! I will be occasionally uploading more videos in Portuguese, just not on a weekly basis!
