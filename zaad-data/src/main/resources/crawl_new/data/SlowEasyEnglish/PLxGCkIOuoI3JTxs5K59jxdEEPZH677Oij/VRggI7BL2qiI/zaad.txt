George Zimmerman case - the jury was right to acquit?
Published on Jul 14, 2013
George Zimmerman was acquitted and found not guilty of the murder and manslaughter of Trayvon Martin. Was the jury correct in their decision? Did the prosecution do a good job? Did they present enough evidence to convict him? This is my opinion on the matter. You decide. http://www.sloweasyenglish.com More Links: http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
