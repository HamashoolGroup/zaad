Published on Jan 11, 2014
This video was actually supposed to go up before the last one. This one should have been number 21 and 21 should have been number 22. Sorry for the mix-up. This is just a video of the drive from our hotel to the Fairy Stream. There is no talking, just a view of the countryside as we drive along.
