Daily Vlog #16: Vietnam! Tasting "Bia Saigon" (Saigon Beer)
Published on Jan 3, 2014
Wow! I can't believe I've already been back from my holiday for three days! Time really does fly. And now we're already in 2014, so... Happy New Year everyone! Unfortunately, internet access was not always possible while I was in Vietnam so I've got a few more videos in my camera that I didn't have a chance to upload while there. I will be putting them up over the next few days. In this one, I show you the beach and taste my first Vietnamese beer, "Bia Saigon".
