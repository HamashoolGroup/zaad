Daily Vlog # 4: Tour of a Japanese neighborhood
Published on Dec 5, 2013
A few people on my previous vlogs commented and suggested that I do some vlogging about things in Japan. So that's what I did today. Today's vlog is a short walk around a neighborhood near me and in in the video, we take a look at a typical Japanese style park, a few very cool Japanese vending machines, a Daiso shop (similar to the dollar stores in North America) and a quick look at a train station. This video is a long one - over 20 minutes! - so it'll give you lots of listening practice. Of course, I speak slowly and use pretty easy English throughout so understanding everything shouldn't be too much of a problem. Good luck and if you have any questions, feel free to comment either on YouTube or directly on the website at www.sloweasyenglish.com. Thanks for watching!
