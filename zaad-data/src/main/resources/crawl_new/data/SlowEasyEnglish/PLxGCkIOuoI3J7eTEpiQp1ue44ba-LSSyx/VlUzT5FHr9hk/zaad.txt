Daily Vlog #23: Vietnam! Walking tour of Fairy Stream
Published on Jan 16, 2014
Warning: Most of the sound in this video is OK but there are some parts where the wind is very strong and you can't hear what I'm saying. Lots of talking in this one! This is a longer video, nearly 30 minutes, of us walking in the Fairy Stream during our holiday in Vietnam. (We also saw the name Fairy Spring so I'm not sure which is the official name.) The stream itself is very shallow and easy to walk in. The sand in this area is a bright orange/red that is really quite beautiful and the rock formations caused by erosion are very cool, too. Worth a visit if you're ever in the area. My only regret is that it appears we made a mistake. Our little guide, Tom, pointed out a sign to us that indicated there would be ostrich rides further down and also mentioned a waterfall (I think that's what he said) but we got to a point where there didn't seem to be anything else so we turned around. Maybe if we had continued walking a little further, we might have finally found the waterfall?
