Daily Vlog #25: Vietnam! How much to rent a motorbike? And is Pho delicious?
Published on Jan 16, 2014
How much does it cost to rent a motorbike for a day in Vietnam? It depends on where you go and, apparently, on who you're talking to - even if you go back to the same place. LOL And is Pho any good? And how do you pronounce that word, after all? Well, one of the waitresses at the resort told me so now I am finally able to say it! Hmmm, maybe Vietnamese people would laugh at my pronunciation, but it's pretty close, I think! The waitress said I did very well. :-) Visit the website for 100's more videos! http://www.sloweasyenglish.com More Links: http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
