Published on Jan 11, 2014
On our way to a tourist spot called the Fairy Stream (or Fairy Spring), the most amazing smell permeated the air and tingled my olfactory senses. Oh my God! I have to have some of that!!! What is that smell and where is it coming from??! I never did find out the exact Vietnamese name for it though, unfortunately. If someone watching this knows what it is, please let me know! Thanks.
