The best way to learn English - Part 6 : How many words do you need to know?
Published on Jul 10, 2013
This is the 6th video in the series "The best way to learn English". How much vocabulary do you need to learn to speak English? How many words are enough? How long will it take to learn them? In this video, I calculate how much time it will take for the average person to learn enough words to speak and understand English! **** This is a re-shoot. I made a mistake in the original video and I wanted to fix it. The mistake was in the calculation of the total number of hours. I said it was 5000 hours but it's actually 500 hours! If you've seen the original video, the content is almost exactly the same except for that calculation. Sorry for the trouble! **** For the other videos in the series, click on the following links: Part 1 - What you need to speak English: http://youtu.be/5Pk9qvrc2gs Part 2: The importance of pronunciation: http://youtu.be/Cu_68SNqy64 Part 3: Learning grammar without rules: http://youtu.be/z3E9gHBP7_o Part 4: How NOT to learn vocabulary: http://youtu.be/NKINhRmsqvg Part 5: The right way to learn vocabulary: http://youtu.be/9g1DNIohFD0 Part 6: How many words do you need to know?: http://youtu.be/n7edCdWxyaQ Part 7: Stop studying!: http://youtu.be/380ogCUeIr8 Part 8: Where to get good input: http://youtu.be/GT531DRo52I Part 9: Living in English: http://youtu.be/QAihWpxrtqc Part 10: Take action!: http://youtu.be/7bW6Im-Dcyw Links: http://www.sloweasyenglish.com http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
