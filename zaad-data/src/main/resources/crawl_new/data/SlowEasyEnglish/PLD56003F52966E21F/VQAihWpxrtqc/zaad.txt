This is the 9th video in the series "The best way to learn English". English is not a goal. It is simply a tool for accomplishing other things. In Part 7 and Part 8, I showed you how important it is to get a lot of real, meaningful input and gave suggestions on how to get it. In this video, I show you how you can take it one step further and start LIVING in English.
