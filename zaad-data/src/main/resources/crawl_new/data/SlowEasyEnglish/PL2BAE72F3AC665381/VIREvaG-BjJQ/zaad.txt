God intends rape? Mourdock says no to abortion for rape victims
Published on Oct 23, 2012
Richard Mourdock said that if a woman gets pregnant from rape, she should not have the right to an abortion and that "God intended for it to happen". Crazy! Update: I finally heard the pronunciation of the guy's name on the news. I guessed wrong because of the spelling but it seems that it's pronounced exactly the same as Murdock. (First part sounds like the first syllable in "mermaid".)
