How to eat sukiyaki in Japan
Published on May 26, 2015
Sushi may be the most popular food to come out of Japan but if raw fish isn't your thing, there are many other dishes you can try. For the beef-lover, be sure to try sukiyaki on your visit to the Land of the Rising Sun. Comprised of mainly beef and an assortment of vegetables, sukiyaki is a meal you'll definitely want to try more than once. But like many things in Japan, eating sukiyaki is not as simple as sitting down at your table and ordering it. In most restaurants, you'll be given the ingredients and will have to make it yourself. Watch this video to learn how to eat sukiyaki at an all-you-can-eat restaurant in Japan!
