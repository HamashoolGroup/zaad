Published on Sep 14, 2012
Who is Sam Bacile? The anti-Muslim filmmaker responsible for creating the movie "Muhammad", now known as "Innocence of Muslims", first used the name Sam Bacile and said that he was an Israeli Jew, but no records of this name could be found. It turns out that the man used several aliases to hide behind and that his true identity is now believed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and thought to be a Coptic Christian.
