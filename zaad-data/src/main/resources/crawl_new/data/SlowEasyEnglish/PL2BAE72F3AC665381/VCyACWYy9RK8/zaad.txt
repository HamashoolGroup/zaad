Hurricane Sandy, evacuation and climate change (global warming)
Published on Oct 29, 2012
Is Hurricane Sandy the result of climate change / global warming? Are fossil fuels contributing to these terrible storms in the recent past? And why are there stupid, selfish people who refused to evacuate? Good luck to everyone in Hurricane Sandy's path!
