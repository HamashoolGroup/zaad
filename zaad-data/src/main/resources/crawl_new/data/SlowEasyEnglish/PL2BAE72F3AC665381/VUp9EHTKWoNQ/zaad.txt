How to order, eat and pay for sushi in Japan (at a conveyer belt sushi restaurant)
Published on Feb 10, 2014
If you ever come to Japan for a visit, be sure to check out a conveyer belt sushi restaurant! Watching food roll by your table and grabbing what you want as it goes by is one of those ideas that seems wacky but is actually awesome. However, it might be a little tricky if you don't read or understand Japanese. There is very little English in this restaurant so here is a video that explains everything, from getting a table to paying the bill. Watch and enjoy!
