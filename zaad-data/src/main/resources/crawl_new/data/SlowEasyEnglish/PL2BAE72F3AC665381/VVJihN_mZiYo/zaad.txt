A ride on the world's fastest train - The Shanghai Maglev
Published on Jul 12, 2014
Last week, I took a ride on the Shanghai Maglev train, which is the fastest train in the world with a top speed of 431 kilometers per hour! That is unbelievably fast! This is the video I took while going from the Pudong International Airport to Longyang Road Station. By the way, "maglev" is short for "magnetic levitation". The train has no wheels and floats on a cushion of air above magnets. Enjoy!
