Daily Vlog #14: Vietnam! Awesome breakfast buffet
Published on Dec 27, 2013
One of my favorite things about vacation is when the hotel I'm staying at has a great breakfast. This is one of those hotels. There is a plethora of foods to choose from and all of them are delicious! I have to say, this place really does have quite a good restaurant. Nearly every dish we've eaten here has been very good.
