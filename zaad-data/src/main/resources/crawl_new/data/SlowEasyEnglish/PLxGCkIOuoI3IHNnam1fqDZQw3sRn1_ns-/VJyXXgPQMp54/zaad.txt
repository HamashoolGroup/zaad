How to find the cheapest taxis at the airport in Manila, Philippines
Published on Feb 8, 2016
If you don't know what you're doing, it's easy to get ripped off by taking the wrong taxi at NAIA in Manila, Philippines. When you arrive at Terminal 3 and come out the doors, you'll be asked where you are going. Do NOT talk to these people. They are working for the "coupon taxi" companies. These taxis are white and overcharge by three to five times what a regular airport taxi costs! By walking just a few steps, you can get a yellow metered taxi and pay up to 80% less (paying $4 USD instead of $20)! Watch the video to learn how easy it is to find the cheaper taxis and avoid the overcharging scam.
