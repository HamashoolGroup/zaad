Cost of living in the Philippines: Groceries in Manila 2
Published on Mar 13, 2016
Link to 1st groceries video: https://youtu.be/ksKpVub5LcI What is the cost of living in Manila, Philipines? More specifically, how much does the food cost at the grocery store? This is my 2nd video looking at the cost of groceries in Manila, Philippines. In this video, there are more everyday items (fewer snacks) and also fewer imported items, so it gives a better idea of "real" grocery costs for those who don't buy those things. Products discussed: - whole wheat bread - cookies - green peppers - cucumbers - Parmesan cheese - pancit canton (like ramen noodles) - cantaloupe - rice (the cheapest rice in the supermarket) - toilet paper - eggs - tomato sauce - milk (low fat and whole fat) - water If you like this video, be sure to click the like button, share it and leave me a comment! If people like it, I'll do more similar ones. :)
