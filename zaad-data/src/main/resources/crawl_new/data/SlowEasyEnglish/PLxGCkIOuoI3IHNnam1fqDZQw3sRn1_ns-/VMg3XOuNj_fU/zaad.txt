Daily Vlog #7: Best dish EVER! Is this really Japanese food??!
Published on Dec 17, 2013
Sorry about the sound. The background noises were quite loud and it seems that the camera didn't pick up my voice very well. It's sometimes a little difficult to hear me but if you listen closely, you can. I shot this vlog the same day as Vlog #6, just a short while later. In this video, I show you my absolutely favorite meal ever. This one tops them all and if I had to choose one last meal, this would be it. It's absolutely amazing. And yet, when I tell people about it, many think it sounds disgusting. Surprisingly, I've only seen this in Japan. The ingredients themselves are eaten elsewhere too, but as far as I know, the method of preparation is unique to Japan, so this is "Japanese food" but you would never have imagined it to be!
