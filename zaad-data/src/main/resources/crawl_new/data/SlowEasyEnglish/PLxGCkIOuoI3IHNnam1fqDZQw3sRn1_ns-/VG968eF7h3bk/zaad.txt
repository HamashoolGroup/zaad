Vietnam street food - Only $5 for awesome beef BBQ! (Bo Nam Nuong)
Published on Oct 7, 2015
The other day I tried a dish here in Hanoi, Vietnam that was fantastic. I didn't know the name of what I was eating but I knew I had to have it again so tonight I went out on a search for it. It didn't take long to find it in the Old Quarter and I finally learned the name of the dish. It's called Bo Nam Nuong -- and it's fantastic! Definitely, if you're ever in Vietnam, you gotta try it. If you're a meat eater, I guarantee you'll go back for more.
