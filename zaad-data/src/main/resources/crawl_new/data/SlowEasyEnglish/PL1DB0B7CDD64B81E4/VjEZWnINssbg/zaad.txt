How to read very large numbers in English
Published on Mar 9, 2016
Very large number can be very difficult to learn when studying a new language. If the numbers in your language are similar to English numbers, then it's not too bad, but if your number system is different, like it is in Japanese, then it can take a very long time to get used to! When I moved to Japan, it took me a very long time to get used to numbers in Japanese because the way to say numbers is so different after 10,000!
