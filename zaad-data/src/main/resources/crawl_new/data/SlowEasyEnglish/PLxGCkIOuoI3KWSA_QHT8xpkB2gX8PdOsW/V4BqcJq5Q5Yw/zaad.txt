Click on the link to go to my new channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQVL... Click here to watch the second video! https://youtu.be/Gj9GylcQu1I Today I decided to get in shape and start a fitness program. For this, I created a new channel to document my progress in real time. I hope that doing this will motivate others to join me to get fit and subscribe to the channel so that we can all motivate and support each other. If you have been thinking about starting an exercise program, subscribe to the SimulFit channel and share your progress and tips too!
