A taste of the Hanoi Night Market
Published on Oct 11, 2015
Here's a little video to show you a bit of the Hanoi Night Market. If you're ever in Hanoi during the weekend, be sure to check it out. It's held every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night from 7 pm till 12 midnight. You can buy all sorts of things for cheap, such as assorted crafts, art, sunglasses, t-shirts, shorts, pants, knick knacks, handmade greeting cards, toys, bags, socks, jewelry, iPhone cases, and the list goes on. Be sure to haggle though. Never accept the first price offered to you or you will be overpaying by quite a bit! To get there, just head to the north end of Hoan Kiem Lake where you'll see a big roundabout with insane traffic and the market is just north of that. Good luck crossing the road!
