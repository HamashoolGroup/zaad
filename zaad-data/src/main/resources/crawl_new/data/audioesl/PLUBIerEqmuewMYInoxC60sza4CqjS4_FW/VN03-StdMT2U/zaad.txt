How To Say You ?Know? A Place In English?
Published on Feb 2, 2016
Did you know that there is a common mistake many English students make when they want to ask if you?ve been somewhere or visited a place? Look at a comment Gerson left on the last video: Is it correct to say, ?I'd like to KNOW United States?? I said this once to an American I met on the street. But later I thought I should have used ?VISIT?. Thanks in advance. That?s the same thing that many Spanish, Portuguese, and French speakers say about ?knowing a place?. However, in English we generally use other verbs like ?go?, ?visit?, ?live?, or ?been?. Watch the video to learn how to ask these kinds of questions correctly in English at http://exlenglish.com/how-to-use-the-... Here are the phrases used in the video for you to follow along with. * Have you ever been to London? * Would you like to visit Paris? * We went to Europe in 2010 * How long have you lived in Brazil?
