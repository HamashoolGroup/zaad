Published on May 5, 2012
American Accent Training -- Ah Sound | Speak fluent English with an American accent. AH: When your upper jaw as well as your lower jaw expand apart. Which means your upper jaw goes up, and your lower jaw goes down..... you make an AAH sound. Keeping in mind that your check muscles need to remain straight, and your mouth will form a shape of an oval. For example, Car : kAH-r Garnish : gAHr-nish Far : fAH-r Garden : gAHr-den Bar : bAH-r Pardon : pAHr-don Jar : jAH-r Party : pAHr-ty Mars : mAH-rs Hard : hAHr-d Darts : dAHr-ts Guard : gAHr-d Lava : lAH-vAH Cards : kAHr-ds I bought a new Car How far is the market I saw two guys sitting at the Bar In the cupboard there is a jar of jam. Aliens come from Mars. Have you ever played a game of darts? A volcano erupts Lava..... We still need to garnish the potatoes...... I beg your pardon, could you please repeat yourself? Get ready soon, we need to go to a party. I've always found math to be so hard. You should always have a security guard. There's one thing that we can do, why don't we play cards?
