American Accent Training | British Accent Training
This play list will help non-native speakers of English learn to speak with an American accent. You will learn to produce the standard American accent. Some people also call it "broadcaster English." It's the kind of standard, neutral speech that you hear on CNN and in educated circles. It's a non-regional American accent, meaning that people do not associate the dialect with any particular part of the United States. It is the accent most commonly associated with educated people in the American East, Midwest, and West. Listen to the recorded material over and over. You will hear words and sentences pronounced followed by a pause for you to repeat after the speaker. You may want to record yourself repeating so that you can compare your accent to the accents of the speakers on this audio. Then practice the new sounds in real-life situations.
