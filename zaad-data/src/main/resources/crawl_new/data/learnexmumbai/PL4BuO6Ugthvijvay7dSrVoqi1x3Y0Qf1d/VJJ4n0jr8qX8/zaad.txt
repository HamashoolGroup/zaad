Example: Jane came to my party. Samara came to my party. Jane and Samara came to my party. 2. But: is used to show contrast. So, if we talk about two things, people or ideas that are contrasting each other, we use ?but?. Example: Mrs. Smith is strict. Mrs. Smith is kind. Mrs. Smith is strict but kind. (strict and kind are contrasting qualities) 3. So: indicates effect, result or consequence. It also expresses ?purpose? in a sentence. For example: Write down the address, so we don?t forget it. 4. Or: presents an alternative or a choice. Example: Do you want pasta or rice? 5. Because/since/as: are used to give reasons. They can be used interchangeably. Example: I sat down because/since/as I was tired. 6. After/before/when: are all time related conjunctions. Example: I?ll email you after I receive the update. (after shows the sequence where one action id followed by the other) Example: I?ll email you before I receive the update. (before shows one action happens prior to the other or precedes the other) Example: I?ll email you when I receive the update.
