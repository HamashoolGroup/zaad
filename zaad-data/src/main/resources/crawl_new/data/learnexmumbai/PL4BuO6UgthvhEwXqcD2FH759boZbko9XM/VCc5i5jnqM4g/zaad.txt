Articles - a, an & the - English Grammar lesson Take the quiz - http://www.learnex.in/articles-a-an-the/ The 3 articles in English are a, an and the. The learner has to decide noun-by-noun which one of the articles to use. In fact, there are 4 choices to make, because sometimes no article is necessary. Native-speakers, of course, use the articles correctly without thinking. English learners, on the other hand, need to have some guidelines for making the right choice - particularly those learners whose own language does not have articles. The guidelines that follow in this lesson should help ESL students to a basic understanding of English article use. The words a, an and the are known as articles. ? We use an before words that begin with vowels (a,e,i,o,u). E.g. I found an orange boat. However there are few exceptions like the words honest and hour. In the words honest and hour the alphabet h is silent and therefore the letter o becomes the first alphabet of the word and hence we use the article an. E.g. Mr. Smith is an honest man. I will be with you in an hour. We use a before words that begin with consonants (all the letters of the alphabet except the vowels). E.g. Bumble is a baby elephant. ? We use the before words that we have already spoken about. E.g. I bought an apple. The apple is very sweet.
