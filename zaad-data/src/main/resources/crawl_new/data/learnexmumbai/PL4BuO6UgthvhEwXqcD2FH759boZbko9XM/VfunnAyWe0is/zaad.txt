Difference between 'Almost', 'Almost All' and 'Most' - English Grammar Lesson http://www.letstalkpodcast.com A lot of people get confused while using expressions like most, almost all and almost. This lesson brings out the difference between most/almost all and almost. Most/almost all : are quantifiers. 'Most' is used to talk about a majority of something (75% - 98%) and 'Almost all' is greater than most. So, almost all is about 99%, but not all (100%). Example : All most all her friends bought Maria gifts for her birthday. (this means around 99% of her friends gifted Maria something, but not all her friends.) Example : Most of the students of our school dislike Math. (a majority of students). Almost : means nearly/ close to. It is not a quantifier. Example : I almost missed my flight. (this means I just boarded it in time before it was too late. I was close to missing my flight.) Example : Lisa almost cried when she saw John after many years. (this means she didn't cry. She actually contained herself and was not far from crying. She nearly cried, probably her eyes were cloudy but tears didn't roll down her cheek.)
