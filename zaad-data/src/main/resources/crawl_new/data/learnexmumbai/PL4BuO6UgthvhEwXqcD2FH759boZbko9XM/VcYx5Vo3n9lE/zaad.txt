But, at times it is confusing when we have to use them to make a question. In this lesson, you will learn when to use ?shall? and ?we? to make a question. Shall I/We: is used when the person who asks the question is offering to do something. Example: Shall we wait for you? (we are offering to the action of waiting.

Will I/We: is used when you ask general questions, where you are not initiating an action or offering to do something: Example: Will I get a call from him? Example: Will we receive an invitation for the party? Example: ill I ever know the truth? Example: Will I recover soon from the viral?
