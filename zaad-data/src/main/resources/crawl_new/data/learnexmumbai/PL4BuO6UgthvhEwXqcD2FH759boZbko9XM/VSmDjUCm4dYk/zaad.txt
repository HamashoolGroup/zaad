You will learn how to use the transitional phrase ?Having said that? in your daily English conversation. This phrase has become more and more common in the spoken English language.

Example: Their work has been fairly good. Having said that, I still think there's room for improvement. (In this sentence, first you appreciate and compliment the work done. But, in the latter sentence, you say there is scope for improvement. So, you have contradicted your first sentence to some extent.) Their work has been fairly good. That said, I still think there's room for improvement. Example: John forgets most things. Having said that, he always remembers my birthday. (first you say he?s forgetful, but you contrast by saying he remembers your birthday) John forgets most things. That said, he always remembers my birthday. Example: This caf? is expensive. Having said that, the food here is really nice. This caf? is expensive. That said, the food here is really nice.
