Published on Aug 4, 2013
Using : Good Vs Well Many people think they can use the words ;Good' & Well interchangeably, In this lesson NIharika explains the correct usage of these two words. Many people use the word good to describe how they did on a test, or how they did during a game. They will say, "I did real good," or "I played very good." There is a better way to say these sentences, especially when you write them. Say, "I did well on that test," or "I played very well." Use well as an adverb. Use well to describe how something is done. Use good as an adjective. Use good to describe nouns ? persons, places & things.
