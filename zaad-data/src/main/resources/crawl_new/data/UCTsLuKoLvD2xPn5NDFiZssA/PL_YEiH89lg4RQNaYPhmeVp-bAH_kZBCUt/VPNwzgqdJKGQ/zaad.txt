Rhonda L. Bowen talking at the BESIG Pre-Conference Event at the IATEFL 2010 Annual Conference in Harrogate, UK. "What is the slant that makes us professional? In order to teach specialised subjects we should have a basic understanding of them in order to be credible. If we want to set ourselves apart from others, we have to be bold enough to understand something about what our clients do and therefore need to communicate in English to others. Lets investigate our USPs and find our niche in the market. In the afternoon workshop, we will brainstorm ways to improve our professional knowledge."
