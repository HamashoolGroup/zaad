Uploaded on Feb 10, 2010
Today's words: Liquidity, liquid market, small fluctuations, frequent sales, narrow spreads, I teach ESL EFL English as a second language, mostly business English these days, but I do all lessons. Read, write, talk speak practice right here with the free teacher Phil! Free English as a second language practice lessons are available every day. Business English, such as economics, banking, finance and insurance lessons are rare so hopefully I can help you!
