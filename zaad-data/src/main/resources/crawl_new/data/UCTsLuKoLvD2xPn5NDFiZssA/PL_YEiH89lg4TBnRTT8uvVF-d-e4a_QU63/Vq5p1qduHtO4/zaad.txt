Learn Business English Lesson 134 (core inflation, substitution)
Uploaded on Feb 5, 2010
Today's words: inflation rate, core inflation, substitution, adjustments for quality. This is an economics lesson designed for business English as a second language (ESL) students. I am a free teacher of all things English. I wish you the best of luck in your speaking practice. You could spend money on a tutor but if you are already advanced, why not just watch online free lessons... I like to talk about economics and business words because it's fun stuff.
