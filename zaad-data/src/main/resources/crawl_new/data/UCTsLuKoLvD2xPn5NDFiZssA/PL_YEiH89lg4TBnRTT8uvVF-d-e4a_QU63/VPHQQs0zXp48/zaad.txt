Learn Business English 189 (Employee stock plan, glass ceiling, leverage)
Uploaded on Feb 9, 2010
Today's words: Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), glass ceiling, and leverage. I teach ESL EFL English as a second language, mostly business English these days, but I do all lessons. Read, write, talk speak practice right here with the free teacher Phil! Free English as a second language practice lessons are available every day. Business English, such as economics, banking, finance and insurance lessons are rare so hopefully I can help you speak fluent business English!
