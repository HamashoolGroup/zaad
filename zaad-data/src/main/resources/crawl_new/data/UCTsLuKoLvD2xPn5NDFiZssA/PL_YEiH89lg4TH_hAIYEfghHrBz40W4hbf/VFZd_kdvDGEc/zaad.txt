Business English lesson: describing products with descriptive vocabulary
Published on Oct 14, 2014
This business English video tip is about describing products. You may need to do this for a potential customer. It could be for a sales presentation or meeting or you might be writing marketing material. One incredibly important thing to remember is to use strong, descriptive adjectives and adverbs. This will add power to your presentation. It will help bring your product alive and make the presentation, sales meeting or marketing literature a lot more effective. In the video, I use an example of a review of the iPhone 6 which Stephen Fry wrote for The Guardian. You can read the full review here: http://www.theguardian.com/technology...
