Learn Business Conversation English Lesson 160 (sales presentation, brochure)
Uploaded on Feb 6, 2010
Today's lesson words: sales presentation, brochure, pamphlet, business card. I wish you the best of luck in learning English as a second language (ESL). Business English, whether conversation or vocabulary is difficult so I hope to keep posting videos. You can study at home for free and talk with your friends for practice. I am a free school teacher available on YouTube so subscribe, rate and comment!
