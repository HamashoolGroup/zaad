(turn on captions 'cc' in the menu below if required) Targeted English: A range of free tutorials for learners of Business English and General English by an experienced Business English trainer, English ESOL exam tutor and General English teacher. My aim is to help you understand and use different parts of English for your business and for your personal life - be part of the global conversation in English - British Council Quotation: "English is spoken at a useful level by some 1.75 billion people worldwide ? that?s one in every four. By 2020, we forecast that two billion people will be using it ? or learning to use it. And it is the economically active, the thought leaders, the business decision-makers, the young, the movers and shakers present and future who are learning and speaking English. They are talking to each other more and more and English is the ?operating system? of that global conversation."
