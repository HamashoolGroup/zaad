English lesson. Describing downward movement in Graphs
Published on Jan 15, 2016
Here is the second video about describing movement in graphs. The first video talked about upward movements, this second video talks about downward movement. In a business meeting, you may need to talk about a decrease, drop, fall or decline in sales, productivity, subscriptions or something similar. It's really important to get the vocabulary correct. In this video, I will tell you what verbs you can use and show you some examples with graphs.
