Learn English verbs for talking about your job roles - Business English
Published on Jan 23, 2014
Business English - 6 important verbs you can use when describing your different job roles and responsibilities. On your business card you usually have one job title that explains your position in your company or your sector of work if you are self-employed. However, when you have to describe to a client, supplier or colleague in English exactly what you do and your responsibilities, you will almost certainly have a variety of things to explain and list the various things you do. These 6 verbs I am suggesting here are very common in Business English and can be used when meeting people, and introducing yourself. They are all very useful to make enquiries and asking for the person who you need to speak to regarding a certain matter or in a certain department of a larger company. Each verb is flexible and interchangeable when speaking about job roles. The lesson is about giving you a wider range of verbs to use in these situations or when you are listing your roles, and this improves your communication and is less repetitive than just using one verb in your description. I hope you enjoy the video and learn something new. The 6 verbs are: to manage to be in charge of to be responsible for to take care of to deal with LISTENING TEST in VIDEO When reading the 5 sentences describing roles I say one thing incorrectly. Did you notice? The sentence: I also look after the plant personnel, HR....Human Resources. I say 'H and R', which is incorrect. The article 'and' is not used in this acronym. The correct pronunciation is H R.
