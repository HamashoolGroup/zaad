Learn the secrets to NATURAL learning in this video lesson! Welcome back to video lesson four in your free 7 Day Email Video Course from EnglishAnyone.com. I'm Drew Badger, co-founder of EnglishAnyone.com, and today we are going to start learning, the easy, automatic, English Anyone way! Let's begin by thinking like a scientist. Imagine you're working on an experiment. You have two different plants and you want to compare how much water is good for your plant. You have water, sunlight, soil and these three things are what help a plant grow. If, in an experiment, you change the water, but keep the soil and sunlight the same, then you can test how much water is good for your plant. So, in our experiment, we have the same amount of soil, the same amount of sunlight and we change the water level a little bit. We find out that this water level is better than this water level. You need to learn English the same way. Imagine if you do the same experiment again but have different levels of sunlight, different amounts of soil and different amounts of water. Do you think it would be possible to tell how much water is good for the plant? Absolutely not! The whole point of an experiment is to find one thing and test for it. In English learning, it's the exact same thing. What you want to do is figure out some one, new thing that you want to learn or, when you are reading or listening, find something that is only teaching you one new thing and you will be able to absorb it much, much faster. Let's begin with the reading example. If you want to read something like a novel or another non-fiction story, or if you want to watch a movie, would you watch a movie that you only understand 50% of? Or would you think it would be better to watch something or read something that you understand, maybe, 80-90% of? If you said 80-90%, you would be correct.
