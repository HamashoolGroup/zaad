If you've been following my videos for a long time, you're used to my voice and are ready to begin training with this new series of English lessons at native speed. If you're new to the channel, I recommend you spend lots of time reviewing my older videos so you can get used to my accent and intonation. Add too the conversation in the comments to practice even more! If you enjoyed this lesson, be sure to like and share it. As soon as it gets over 10,000 views, I'll release a new video in this series. :) For our best training to help you understand even fast native speakers with difficult accents, click here: http://www.englishanyone.com/speak-fl...
