Advanced English Listening Practice - 10 - English Lesson at Fast, Native Speed - Bath Time
Published on Oct 12, 2015
For our best training to help you speak English naturally, confidently and automatically, just like a native speaker, click here: http://www.englishanyone.com/speak-fl... In this video, I talk how my interest in Japanese design "pulled" me to fluency. If you want to get fluent - and you're not someone who studies languages just to study languages - start with the final result, the reason why you want to speak. Then work backward from that result to plan your path to speaking confidence. Gardening and Japanese spatial design are the two things that gave me the motivation to keep practicing, even though I struggled to learn for a long time. Find your true reason for learning and you'll get fluent faster. This is a new series I've created to help long-time followers of my channel take their listening skills to a higher level. If you've been following my videos for a long time, you're used to my voice and are ready to begin training with this new series of English lessons at native speed. If you're new to the channel, I recommend you spend lots of time reviewing my older videos so you can get used to my accent and intonation. Add too the conversation in the comments to practice even more! If you enjoyed this lesson, be sure to like and share it. As soon as it gets over 10,000 views, I'll release a new video in this series. :) For our best training to help you understand even fast native speakers with difficult accents, click here: http://www.englishanyone.com/speak-fl...
