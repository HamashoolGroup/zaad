http://www.englishanyone.com/power-le... Learn to express yourself confidently in fluent English and sound like a native speaker with our FREE Power Learning video course! To get fluent faster, play with patterns! Language learning is all about recognizing patterns! Like math, English is nothing more than a code we use to express ourselves. Sometimes there are bugs in the code that make things difficult to understand, but the rules of English are usually very standard and pretty easy to learn. To help you get fluent faster, we want you to play with the code of English by making your own words! Let's look at an example: English words are usually broken down into pieces. The piece, "ify," means "to make". To make something beautiful is to beautify it. To electrify something means to charge it with electricity. Once you recognize grammar patterns, you can begin to play with words to see if you can make correct ones. The opposite of beautiful is ugly. So, to make something ugly, you would uglify it! Now some people might correct your English, as there are exceptions to grammar patterns, but usually you'll be right! Even if a word is not correct, native speakers will understand your meaning and help you to correct your sentences. Just be brave and don't worry about making mistakes! Understand the patterns of English, and begin to play with words, and you will get fluent in English faster! Some words might not always be correct, but native speakers will respect you more for your creativity! And you might just create a new English word that other people start using! Now get out, listen for patterns and start having fun with words!
