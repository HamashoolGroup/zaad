http://www.englishanyone.com/power-le... Learn to express yourself confidently in fluent English and sound like a native speaker with our FREE Power Learning video course! To get fluent faster, act like babies! Most students begin studying English by learning how to introduce themselves. They also learn to ask directions to the bust stop, the bank and the bathroom. What you don't usually learn in lessons, however, are the names of all the little things you see every day but don't think to ask about. Babies see the world differently than we do. Everything is new to them and they are excited to explore all of the things we don't notice anymore. We want you to act like babies and get excited about everything you see. Ask questions about all of the little things around you because, like a baby, the word for each one is new to you. Here are some examples of what we mean: This is a wrench. Here is a knocker. This is a hinge. And this is a faucet. So why is it important to ask about all of these little things? Because the more you ask questions, the faster you'll become fluent. You'll be speaking more and also be learning lots of cool new words and phrases. Ask about the little things and ask questions often. See if you can find something that a native speaker doesn't even know the word for. You can start a great conversation when you find words both of you don't know. Remember that we don't want you to just look weird words up in the dictionary. We want you to get into conversations about lots of little things. This is an exercise to help you speak. So get out and ask some native speakers some questions about the little things in life, and you'll be learning quickly and naturally, just like babies do! Check out EnglishAnyone.com for more tips, lessons, videos, and to learn the 7 secrets students must know to get fluent in English quickly! Happy learning!
