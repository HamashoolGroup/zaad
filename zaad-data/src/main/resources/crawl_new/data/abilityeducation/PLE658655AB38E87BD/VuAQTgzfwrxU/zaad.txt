The PRON Method at ABILITY English (Before and After) - Juno
Uploaded on Nov 27, 2011
This video shows a student's progress after one week of the Pronunciation and Fluency at ABILITY English. When you are trying to speak in a second language and people don't understand you it can be very embarrassing and frustrating. At ABILITY Education we believe good pronunciation is very important. When you learn how pronunciation works you improve your listening and increase your fluency. We teach pronunciation and fluency skills using the PRON method. The method is exclusive to ABILITY English and we give our teachers specialised expert training.
