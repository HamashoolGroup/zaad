English Grammar Lesson: Past Simple
Uploaded on Sep 16, 2011
We need your help! We are testing the payment systems on our Premium English course for young learners, and would like your help! It will cost you 1 Euro, but you get a year's subscription that normally cost 99 Euro. If you go to http://www.holmwoods.eu/, scroll to the bottom and click: "I am a primary school pupil (Premium)" You will go through the sign up process. After you have registered you can upgrade your account. To do that you need to enter the code: AYGZH6D4 We are particularly interested in how this works in Germany, but also other countries. You are welcome to share this with your friends, particularly those with young kids..... Feedback would be greatly appreciated!
