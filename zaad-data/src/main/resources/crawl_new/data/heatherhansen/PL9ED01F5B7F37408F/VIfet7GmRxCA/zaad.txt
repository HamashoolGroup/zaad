How to Pronounce 'Heather'
Uploaded on Jan 11, 2012
http://www.EnglishPronunciationCourse... Obviously, I'm quite often asked how to pronounce 'Heather' since that's my name! It's not a very easy name to pronounce. To give you a bit of history, Heather is actually a type of flower that grows all over Europe, especially in Scotland (in England). That's one of the main reasons it was picked up as an English name. If you look closely at the name "Heather", you'll notice it shares the same pronunciation pattern as a few other words. That -eather is the same as in words like 'weather', 'feather' and 'leather'. When I lived in Denmark, I met a guy who was having a lot of trouble saying my name. When I told him it was just like 'weather' and 'feather' he decided to start greeting me with, "Hey, Heather! How's the weather!" It was a good way to remember the pronunciation, anyway! So, now you know how to pronounce my name, Heather, correctly!
