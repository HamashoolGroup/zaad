3 Ways to Overcome Your Fear of Speaking English (Heather Hansen)
Published on Nov 12, 2012
http://www.englishpronunciationcourse... Do you fear speaking English? Do you feel like people don't really know you when you speak English? Do you stay quiet because you want to avoid the embarrassment of making mistakes? You're not alone. In this video I'll share three tips with you to overcome your fear of speaking English. These are the tips that I personally have used to overcome my own fears when I've been speaking foreign languages. I was recently asked why I do what I do. There aren't a lot of people out there with a passion for English pronunciation! I do this because I know first-hand what it's like to struggle speaking another language. I have a Bachelor's Degree in German, although I haven't used the language for many years now, and I'm also fluent in Danish. My husband is Danish and I lived in Denmark for 4 years. I know how hard it can be to speak up in a foreign language. I know how devastating it feels when no one understands. I know how awful it is to feel like no one around you even knows who you are. That's why I do what I do - so you don't have to stuggle, so you can have more confidence, so you can make your mark on this English-dominated world. I hope these three tips help you to take that chance and speak up with confidence in that next business meeting or when you have to deliver your next English presentation. Let me know in the comments how you feel when you speak English and how I can help you.
