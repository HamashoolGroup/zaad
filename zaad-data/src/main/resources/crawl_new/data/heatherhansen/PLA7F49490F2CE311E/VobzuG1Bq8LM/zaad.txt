Accent & Clear Speech - English Pronunciation Lab
Uploaded on Jan 10, 2012
Do you have an accent? Guess what?! So do I! People seem to think that having an accent is a BAD thing, but it's only bad if your accent is so heavy that other people can't understand you. Everyone has an accent -- even the Queen of England! The key to clear and confident communication has nothing to do with your accent, but everything to do with your speech and articulation. Whether you're from Utah or Uganda, New York or New Delhi, focus on speaking clearly, not on changing your accent. If you'd like to learn specific ways to speak more clearly and confidently, head on over to http://www.EnglishPronunciationCourse... and sign up for my FREE, 8-Part, Pronunciation Short Course. I'll see you there!
