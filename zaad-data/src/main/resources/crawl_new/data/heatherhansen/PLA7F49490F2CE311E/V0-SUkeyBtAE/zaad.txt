Syllables - English Pronunciation Lab
Uploaded on Jan 11, 2012
Can you remember, way back when, learning about how words can be broken up into syllables? Syllables are the beats that make up a word, and every syllable includes one vowel sound. For example, we can break the word 'computer' into 3 syllables: COM-PU-TER -- each one having its own vowel sound. So, why are syllables important? Well, in English, one syllable of every word will be stressed (or emphasized) more than the others. You need to know how to break words into syllables, so you can then decide which syllable takes this stress.
