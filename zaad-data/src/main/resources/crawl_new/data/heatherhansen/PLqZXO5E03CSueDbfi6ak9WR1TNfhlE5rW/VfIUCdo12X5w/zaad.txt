Accent Tag - Global English - Californian (Heather Hansen)
Published on Apr 30, 2013
http://englishpronunciationcourse.com http://www.hansencommlab.com Hi everyone! Well, after SO many requests to do an Accent Tag video, I've finally done it! Here you go! I'm originally from Modesto, California, the birthplace of filmmaker George Lucas and Gallo Wineries. I haven't lived in California since 2002, so my accent has definitely changed and I've started incorporating some Global English pronunciations in my speech. I'll try to explain the differences in this video. I would LOVE to see you make one of these videos so I can hear YOUR accent!! Please post your Accent Tag video as a reply to this one so I'm sure to see it! :-) Here's the list. The Words: Aunt, Roof, Route, Wash, Oil, Theater, Iron, Salmon, Caramel, Fire, Water, Sure, Data, Ruin, Crayon, New Orleans, Pecan, Both, Again, Probably, Spitting image, Alabama, Lawyer, Coupon, Mayonnaise, Syrup, Pajamas, Caught, Naturally, Aluminum, Envelope The Questions: 1. What is it called when you throw toilet paper on a house? 2. What is the bug that when you touch it, it curls into a ball? 3. What is the bubbly carbonated drink called? 4. What do you call gym shoes? 5. What do you say to address a group of people? 6. What do you call the kind of spider (or spider-like creature) that has an oval-shaped body and extremely long legs? 7. What do you call your grandparents? 8. What do you call the wheeled contraption in which you carry groceries at the supermarket? 9. What do you call it when rain falls while the sun is shining? 10. What is the thing you change the TV channel with? Looking forward to seeing your videos!
