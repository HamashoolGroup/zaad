That probably seems obvious, but it's so common to rattle off messages without giving any thought to how we feel about them. When you speak, put emotion behind your words. When you're happy, you should sound happy! Smile when you speak, and maybe even add a little laugh to your voice. When something is serious, use your voice as a tool to show how important that message is. Emphasize the words that you want people to remember. Slow down your speech and pause so that people have time to digest what you're saying. By adding more emotion -- more of YOU -- to your speech, you will be better understood. Instead of just stringing words together, you will also make people feel what you feel. And we all know, people don't remember what you say. They remember how you make them feel.
