Learn How to Speak English with Twitter - Interview with Tweetspeak
Published on Jan 28, 2015
http://gonaturalenglish.com In this interview episode, Gabby speaks with Tweetspeak founders Nate and Jason about how you can learn natural English using Twitter. Native speakers use Twitter in a casual way. You can learn phrases like "wanna," "gonna," and others that we use when we speak, but not commonly in professional or academic English writing. We think it's great training for real, native conversation, as well as texting and using social media in English! http://gonaturalenglish.com
