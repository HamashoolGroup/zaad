It?s no secret that across different cultures, there will be things that are acceptable and unacceptable for humor. Aside from culture, there are also personal preferences that determine what you do and don?t find funny. Here are some general guidelines on what is safe and what can be considered dangerous. Let?s begin with some dangerous subjects. Race Religion Region These can be referred to as, ?The Three R?s? Do your best to avoid The Three R?s. Let?s move on to the topics that are generally okay in American culture. Self-Deprecation Sarcasm Irony When you are self-deprecating, that means you?re making fun of yourself. Everyone has made fun of themselves, so this type of humor is very relatable. Using sarcasm is incredibly common in American culture. It is basically just emphasizing something that isn?t true. For example, if it is storming outside you?ll be using sarcasm if you say, ?What a beautiful day?. Irony is the description of clever or unexpected events occurring. Let?s say you were just talking about how much you enjoy the sunshine. Suddenly and storm comes. That would be ironic. Be sure to use these categories of humor in small doses. There can be too much of a good thing. Want to learn more? Take advantage of the online English video classes from Gabby available at www.GoNaturalEnglish.com.
