Is a Native English Teacher Better for You? Here's My Advice
Published on Aug 5, 2014
Find out how you can get matched with a native English speaker to practice here: http://gonaturalenglish.com/ The question is this, ?Is it better to be taught by a native English speaker or a teacher that understands your own language?? This is a great question! Each option has its pros and cons but it all depends on what makes you more comfortable. It all depends on your goals and what you hope to achieve on your language journey. If the teacher also speaks your native language, that can help with your comprehension of the different contexts in English. It will be easier to learn how to express yourself with foreign vocabulary. This is better for a beginner. However, if you feel you?re advanced enough then a native speaker is probably going to be more effective. With a native speaker, you can learn the more complicated things like metaphors or idioms. And native speakers will be the best option for perfecting your pronunciation. There is one more thing that you must be careful of. Your teacher, no matter what their native language is, has to be qualified in some way to teach English. When you look for an instructor make sure they know what they?re doing! But, if you just need a conversation partner then that doesn?t matter. Consider all of these things when you try to figure out who to work with. Only you know what will best help you.
