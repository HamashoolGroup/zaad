When you're having a conversation with an American English speaker, it's important to show that you are listening and interested in what your friends are saying. Here are the words you can use to show your surprise in a friendly, fun, casual way like native English speakers do: Dang That's crazy Oh my gosh / God What?! Whoa! No Way! Really?! You can start using these words right away -- try repeating them after me in the episode! Remember that the way you speak is as important as your pronunciation! Your intonation, feeling, emotion, and stress are important with these words.
