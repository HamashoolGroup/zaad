Therefore, you grow accustom to associating letters and shapes with meaning. Your understanding might only be visual. Listening to English words is vastly different from reading them. You have to associate sounds and phrases with meaning instead of printed words. Mistake #2 Translating Translating can actually be a waste of time. Why? You become focused on translating the English words into your native language and then back into English. This is time consuming and while you are sorting out the vocabulary in your head, you stop listening to the conversation. Mistake #3 Expecting 100% This is probably the biggest mistake you can make. It is unrealistic to try and understand every single thing you read or hear. Instead of striving for absolute perfection, try and set a goal of 60% or 80% comprehension. Just relax and do the best that you can. Patience is the key, so take your time! http://gonaturalenglish.com/
