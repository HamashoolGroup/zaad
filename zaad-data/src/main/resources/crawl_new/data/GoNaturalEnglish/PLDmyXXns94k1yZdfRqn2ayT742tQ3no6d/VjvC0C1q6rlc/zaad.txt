How to Remember Prepositions IN and ON when you Speak English
Published on Feb 6, 2015
http://gonaturalenglish.com/italki http://gonaturalenglish.com In this English tip we're going to learn how to use two confusing prepositions - "in" and "on." We use these prepositions to talk about time. One common mistake is to use the wrong preposition when you're talking about a year, month or day. Remember that when you say only the month, use "in March." If you say a month and a day, use "on March 20th." I saw that I had a plastic container full of tomatoes in my kitchen. So, I decided to explain how to remember this grammar point thinking about the tomatoes. See, the tomatoes are like days and the plastic box is like the month. The tomatoes are in the box. So, we say "in March" as if the month were a box full of days -- or tomatoes. http://gonaturalenglish.com http://gonaturalenglsih.com/italki
