Published on Aug 28, 2014
http://gonaturalenglish.com/ for 6 free premium lessons from the full course ESL Troubleshooting When do you use the verb, ?Do?? If you have ever had trouble, watch and learn from this video. Gabby gives some great explanations. The first example is: ?Do your homework? ?Do? is the main verb of the sentence. It?s very straightforward and easy. Here?s a second example: ?Do you have any questions?? When asking a question, ?Do? has to be used unless another helper verb is already in place. There are plenty of helper verbs, but most of the time you will use, ?Do?. Also, remember that ?Do? comes in different forms. ?Do? ?Don?t ? short for ?Do Not? ?Didn?t?- short for ?Did Not? You will have to use ?Do? a lot in English so don?t underestimate how important it is when forming a question. It will take some practice to get used to asking and answering questions. But once you get the hang of it, your English will sound a lot more natural. Want to learn more? Take advantage of the online English video classes from Gabby available at www.GoNaturalEnglish.com.
