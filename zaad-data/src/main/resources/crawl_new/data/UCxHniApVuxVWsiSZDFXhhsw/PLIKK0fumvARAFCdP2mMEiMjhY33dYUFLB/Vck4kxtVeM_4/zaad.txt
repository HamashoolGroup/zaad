VOA DAILY WORLD NEWS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS July 23, 2015 From Washington, this is VOA news. I'm David Forrest reporting. A thumbs-up from the Saudis. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday the Saudi Arabian leaders have assured him they support the recent nuclear agreement with Iran. Edward Yeranian reports. Saudi state television showed video of the meetings which included the deputy crown prince and defense minister, Mohammed bin Salman. Secretary Carter told journalists traveling with him that Saudi leaders surprisingly did not criticize the Iran nuclear agreement. "Both the king and the minister of defense reiterated their support for the Iranian nuclear deal." Carter said the Saudi king discussed the possibility of a snapback of sanctions on Iran, should Tehran not respect terms of the agreement. Edward Yeranian, Cairo.

The presidential election Tuesday is believed to have had a low turnout as President Pierre Nkurunziza ran without significant opposition for a third term. Burundi opposition leader Agathon Rwasa says dialogue is needed to avoid violence following the controversial election. "War can only destroy, while the dialogue can help us overcome all these troubles of ours." Official vote results are expected Thursday. The elections have been roundly criticized after the government ignored an opposition boycott and calls from the international community for a postponement due to election-related unrest.

U.N. aid agencies report the war has devastated the country's economy and left 21 million of the nation's 25 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Lisa Schlein, Geneva. Greece's banks received a new cash injection from the European Central Bank on Wednesday. The bank official neither confirmed nor denied that the ECB has decided to increase assistance to Greek banks by about $980 million, the second such cash injection in just under a week. Earlier in the day, lawmakers began another debate on a second package of reforms demanded by the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. The White House confirmed Wednesday that the administration is in the "final stages" of drafting a plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama made the closure of the prison a priority when he took office in 2009, but the plan faced numerous setbacks. Inmates have slowly been transferred out. Now only 116 remain.
