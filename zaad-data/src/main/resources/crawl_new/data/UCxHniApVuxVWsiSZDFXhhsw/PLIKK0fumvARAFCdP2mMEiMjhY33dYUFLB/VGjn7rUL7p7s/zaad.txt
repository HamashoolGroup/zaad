U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says implementing the international nuclear agreement with Iran will make the world safer, improve the standard of living for Iranians and potentially open up opportunities between the United States and Iran.

Kerry was interviewed by VOA's Persian service. Ohio Governor John Kasich became the 16th Republican to join the 2016 presidential race Tuesday. Jim Malone reports.

Kasich told a crowd at Ohio State University that he has a proven record. "... and here is how we've done it: by staying together, not by dividing each other, but by staying together with our eyes on the horizon" Kasich has a reputation as an effective budget cutter. But he also has an independent streak and at times has defied his party's conservative wing. Jim Malone, Washington. Pope Francis on Tuesday called on world leaders to take "a very strong stand" on climate change at a United Nations summit later this year in Paris.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was in attendance. "We are committed to an 80 percent reduction (of) greenhouse gases by 2050, mirroring the pledge of so many of you represent here today and we're proud to be the largest city in the world to make that commitment." The declaration states the Paris summit in December may be the last effective opportunity for world leaders to negotiate meaningful environmental policy.
