Taliban chief Mullah Omar annually releases messages in connection with the Muslim Eid festival. But his statement Wednesday offered an unprecedented defense of the recent engagement with Afghan and foreign peace negotiators. The reclusive Taliban leader said the dialogue is a religiously "legitimate" strategy and is part of efforts aimed at driving foreign troops from Afghanistan. Therefore, Mullah Omar says, the Taliban's political endeavors as well as its interactions with Afghans and foreign countries are aimed at bringing an end to the so-called occupation and to establish an independent Islamic system.
