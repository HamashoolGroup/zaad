Gov. Chris Christie discusses his presidential bid SHANNON BREAM, GUEST ANCHOR: I?m Shannon Bream, in for Chris Wallace. In the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Chris Christie makes 14. But is he four years too late? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: I mean, listen, campaigns matter. If they didn't, we?d elect people right now. BREAM: How will his straight talking style play outside New Jersey? You?re a pretty hard charging guy? And what about bridgegate? CHRISTIE: When you're exonerated, then the people who wrongly accused you should have the guts to stand up and say, "I?m sorry." BREAM: The governor sits down to discuss his candidacy only on "Fox News Sunday." Then, Iran nuclear negotiations extended for another week. We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the U.S. and partners are willing to walk away from a bad deal. CROWD: USA, USA! BREAM: Plus, what does the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage mean for religious freedom? We'll debate with Kelly Shackelford, former president of Liberty Institute, and Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry. All, right now, on "Fox News Sunday."
