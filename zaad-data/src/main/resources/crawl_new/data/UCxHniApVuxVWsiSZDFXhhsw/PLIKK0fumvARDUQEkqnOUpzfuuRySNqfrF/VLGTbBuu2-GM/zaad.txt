Fox News Sunday with transcript, July 19 2015 Part 3 - Problem with the Iran deal
Published on Aug 9, 2015
WALLACE: Senator Barrasso, what's your biggest problem with the argument they made? SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R-WY.: A couple things. One is there is bipartisan skepticism about this deal. There's a huge difference between even the framework of three months ago to the deal that just got released the other day, which is very complicated. The inspections that you raised, they were supposed to be anytime anywhere, 24/7, and now, it's going to be 24 days. And this late-minute concession because this administration was so desperate to get any deal signed, the concession that we would now allow Russia to sell to Iran ballistic missiles that could hit in the neighborhood but also with the strength to hit to the United States, I think was an absolute mistake and a concession and almost surrender by the president to get any deal signed. That's my concern. WALLACE: Senator Cardin, did Kerry and Moniz persuade you or do you still have questions? Fox News Sunday Playlist: https://goo.gl/kkOzLc
