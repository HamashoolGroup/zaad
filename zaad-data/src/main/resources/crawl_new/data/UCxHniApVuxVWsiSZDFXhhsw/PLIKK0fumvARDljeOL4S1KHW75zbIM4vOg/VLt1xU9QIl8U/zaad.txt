US Lawmakers, Obama Officials Debate Iran Deal Secretary of State John Kerry debated with members of the U.S. Senate Thursday in the first public hearing on the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Kerry met with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington. During the hearing, Senator Bob Corker said the deal falls short of ending Iran's nuclear program. Mr. Kerry disagreed. In his words, it is "fantasy, plain and simple," to think the United States failed to wait for a better deal in negotiations. Iran and six other countries -- Britain, China, France, Russia, Germany and the United States reached the agreement last week. The U.S. Congress has until September 17 to approve or reject the deal. President Barack Obama has promised to veto a rejection. Secretary Carter makes unannounced stop in Iraq U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter made an unannounced visit Thursday to Baghdad, Iraq.

Mr. Carter also was to meet with top Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and the country's defense minister, as well as U.S. commanders.
