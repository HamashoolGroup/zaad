English Listening Level 1 - Listening English Lesson 20 - Working Outside. Today I was working outside. It was a sunny day, and I was very hot. I wore a hat on my head. I watered all the plants. I weeded the flower beds. I cut back all of the plants that were growing too big. I gave some of the plants plant food. I cut the lawn. I raked the lawn. I filled up the bird baths with water. I swept the sidewalks and the paths. I took out the garbage. I filled the car up with gas. I washed the car. I hung out the clothes on the clothesline. I washed down the lawn furniture. I washed all of the windows on the house from the outside. I was so tired. So I had a glass of lemonade. I talked to my neighbour, and I helped her trim a tree. I planted some bulbs, and then I went into the house. I was exhausted. ? Thanks for watching! ? Please share and like if you enjoyed the video :) thanks so much ? ??????????????????? ?
