Sales English - Sales English Conversations - Business English Lesson
Published on Mar 8, 2014
A sales meeting is designed to learn how to sell a product -- that is, to build relationships, identify needs and outline the benefits of the product. Being able to understand conversations and terms may help you take part in the discussions at a sales meeting, understand what's going on, and make you a more valuable employee and salesperson. In this lesson we will teach you, through some conversations, what you might hear at a sales meeting or what words you might use while in a sales meeting.
