Asking Someone Their Name In English - What's Your Name - English Video Lessons
Published on Mar 23, 2014
We meet new people wherever we go. We can be hesitant in asking people their name because we are self conscious. Sometimes there are situations when we have already met the person but forgotten their name. Let's look at some conversations that will help us to learn, or remember, a person's name. In this lesson we will learn how to ask someone "What's your name?," in many different ways. You'll get more comfortable with asking a stranger for their name, and also with asking someone you've already met to remind you of their name.
