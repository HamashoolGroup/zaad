TOEIC Speaking Skills 3: Respond to Questions
Published on Feb 7, 2013
In the 3rd video of the series, we discuss Questions 4-6 on the TOEIC Speaking Test, RESPOND TO QUESTIONS, and Questions 7-9, RESPOND TO QUESTIONS USING INFORMATION PROVIDED. We analyze and compare/contrast the requirements of both tasks. Finally, due to the specific nature of these question types, I recommend purchasing authentic ETS approved materials to aid in further preparation for these and the other tasks on this section.
