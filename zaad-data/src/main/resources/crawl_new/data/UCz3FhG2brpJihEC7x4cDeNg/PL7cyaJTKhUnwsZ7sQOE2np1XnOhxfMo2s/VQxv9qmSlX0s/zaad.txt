TOEIC Speaking Skills 4: Propose a Solution
Published on Feb 18, 2013
In the 4th video of the series, we examine Question No. 10, PROPOSE A SOLUTION, along with discussing the importance of using Good Customer Service in delivering the response. Finally, due to the specific nature of these question types, I recommend purchasing authentic ETS approved materials to aid in further preparation for these and the other tasks on this section.
