(NOTE: This is a REPOST of a previous video.) In this first video of the series we provide a basic overview of the TOEFL Speaking Section and begin our discussion of the first speaking task-INDEPENDENT SPEAKING-FREE CHOICE. In addition to analyzing the requirements of the task, we also present a preparation exercise to begin helping students learn how to prepare called BRAINSTORMING USING A GRAPHIC ORGANIZER. Finally we discuss how to deliver the response and what basic strategies might be helpful in receiving a better score. The TOEFL Quick Prep Download: http://www.ets.org/c/17722/pdf/qp_v1_....
