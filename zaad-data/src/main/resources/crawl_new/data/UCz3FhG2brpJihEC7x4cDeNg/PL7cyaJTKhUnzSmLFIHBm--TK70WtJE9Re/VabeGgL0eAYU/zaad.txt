Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 7-The Flap "t" and Glottal "t"
Published on Jun 19, 2013
In this video, we explore two sounds common to North American English, the Flap "t" and the Glottal "T". While these sounds are not considered unique phonemes in English, they are represented by IPA symbols as having meaning in the language. We also briefly discuss some differences between North American English pronunciation and British English pronunciation. For more on the differences between North American English and British English, check out Rachel's English YouTube video in conjunction with Anglo-Link, a YouTube channel dedicated to British English pronunciation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIZ78R...
