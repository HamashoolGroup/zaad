Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 5-Additional Vowel Sounds and Diphthongs
Published on Jun 10, 2013
In the 5th video of the series, we explore ADDITIONAL VOWEL SOUNDS, including additional MONOPHTHONGS (vowels using one basic mouth position) and DIPHTHONGS (vowels using two mouth positions). We also review the 10 BASIC VOWEL SOUNDS from the previous video, focusing on how the placement of the tongue is extremely important in producing the different sounds. In the video we reference the excellent University of Iowa's American English Phonetics website to practice these tongue placements: http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonet....
