Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Overview
Published on Jun 4, 2013
In the first video of our series, we present an overview of the objectives of our Summer 2013 Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation course. In this course, we will learn all of the sounds of English (46 as discussed in this series-most linguists agree that there are 44, but we will be taking an expansive view of these), along with the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is a direct way to learn these sounds. In this video we discuss the difference between a PHONEME and a LETTER, as it is defined in English. We also discuss a little bit about the ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, and how this information is going to help improve pronunciation and spelling. This course is designed to accompany our Summer 2013, Session 1 Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation course. It is designed for strictly educational purposes only.
