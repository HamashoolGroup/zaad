Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 9-Basic Phonetic Analysis
Published on Jun 27, 2013
In the final video of this series, we explore how to use the IPA to help better understand the graphemic representation of sounds in English. We take a look at how various words from different language groups are spelled, both graphemically and phonetically, and discuss the various challenges students have when trying to understand the often complicated spelling issues in the language.
