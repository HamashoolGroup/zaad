Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation, Video 2: English Consonants, Graphemes and the IPA
Published on Jun 4, 2013
In the 2nd video of the series, we begin our in-depth presentation of the sounds of English by starting with the 21 SINGLE CONSONANT LETTERS of the English alphabet. We also define the idea of a grapheme and connect it to the historical development of spelling in English. Finally we discuss the importance of the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA, and begin using symbols from that alphabet to help present the sounds we are learning in this series.
