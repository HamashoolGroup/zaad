Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 6-R-Controlled Vowels
Published on Jun 17, 2013
In this 6th video of the series, we address the R-CONTROLLED VOWELS in English. These are specific vowel sounds that are affected by the consonant "r" in the final position. We also discuss what happens when vowels come into contact with VOICED and VOICELESS CONSONANTS.
