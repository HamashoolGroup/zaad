Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 8-The Schwa
Published on Jun 23, 2013
In the 2nd to last video of the series, we look at our final two sounds, the SCHWA and the SCHWA + R. We also briefly discuss the importance of thinking of these two sounds as ideas of RHYTHM, which will be explored in greater detail in our next video series, ADVANCED SPEAKING & PRONUNCIATION.
