Compass Writing Preparation--Part 2: Punctuation
Uploaded on Jan 12, 2012
In part 2 of the video series, we begin looking at the Usage/Mechanics questions by analyzing some PUNCTUATION questions on the test. We discuss how the General Test Strategy (introduced in Part 1) applies to these kinds of questions, and also how punctuation helps to indicate various grammatical and structural ideas. The information from this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... In addition, two websites were discussed in the video for further punctuation and grammar practice: The Purdue OWL: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/sec... and the Capital Community College Quiz Page: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/gramma....
