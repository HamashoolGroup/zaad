COMPASS Writing Preparation-Part 3: Basic Grammar and Usage
Uploaded on Jan 31, 2012
In this video, we continue our discussion of the USAGE/MECHANICS topic by exploring two examples of BASIC GRAMMAR questions. We give a brief overview of the basic idea of grammar and then analyze two questions involving the use of VERBS and PRONOUNS. The information from this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... In addition, two websites were discussed in the video for further punctuation and grammar practice: The Purdue OWL: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/sec... and the Capital Community College Quiz Page: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/gramma....
