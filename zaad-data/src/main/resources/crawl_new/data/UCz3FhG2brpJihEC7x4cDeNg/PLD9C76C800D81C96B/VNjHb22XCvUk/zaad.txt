Published on Aug 21, 2012
In this video, we discuss the STRATEGY subcategory of the RHETORICAL SKILLS section of the COMPASS Writing test. The topics of UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE, RELEVANCE, and COHESION/COHERENCE are addressed, and sample questions are analyzed to help students understand to adapt the Process of Elimination and the overall General Test Strategy to this section of the test. The information from this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... In addition, two resources were discussed in the video for further writing practice: The Purdue OWL: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/sec... and the textbook The Essentials of English by Ann Hogue: http://www.pearsonlongman.com/ae/esse....
