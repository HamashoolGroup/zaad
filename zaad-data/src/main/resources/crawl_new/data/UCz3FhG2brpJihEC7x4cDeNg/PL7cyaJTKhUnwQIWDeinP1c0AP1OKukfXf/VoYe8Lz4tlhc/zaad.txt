Advanced Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 3-Basic Sentence Stress
Published on Jul 16, 2013
In the 3rd video of the series, we begin moving up to SENTENCE STRESS. We talk about which words are generally STRESSED in the sentence and which words we generally UNSTRESS. We also examine the idea of RHYTHMIC UNITS, based on the idea that when sentences become too long, we look for specific places to take a short break to prepare for the next RHYTHMIC UNIT.
