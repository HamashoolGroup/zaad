Advanced Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 5-Unstressed Words and Reductions
Published on Jul 28, 2013
In this video we discuss the other words in the sentence, the STRUCTURE WORDS, and how they will sound as UNSTRESSED ideas. We also look at REDUCTIONS, and then revisit the ideas of STRESS and UNSTRESS and how they will affect the PITCH of the sentence in much the same way they affect the individual sounds of a word.
