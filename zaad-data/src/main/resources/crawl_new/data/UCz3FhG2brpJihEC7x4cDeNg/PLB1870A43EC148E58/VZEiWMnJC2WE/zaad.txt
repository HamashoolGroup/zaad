Compass Reading Preparation--Part IV. Connecting Details .
Uploaded on Oct 31, 2011
In the fourth video of this series, we examine the two types of questions found on the COMPASS reading test--Referring Questions and Reasoning Questions. We discuss the Referring Questions in this video, and explore how to identify the main idea of a paragraph while also applying test strategy and the Process of Elimination on Detail questions. Two very helpful signal word websites: http://lincs.ed.gov/readingprofiles/S... and http://www.somers.k12.ny.us/intranet/.... The sample questions in this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... NOTE: This video series is not licensed or endorsed by ACT and is strictly for educational purposes only. THIS IS AN UPDATED VIDEO POST.
