COMPASS Reading Preparation--III. Understanding Non-Fiction Reading Patterns
Uploaded on Sep 23, 2011
In part 3 of our series, we give a brief overview of the different organizational patterns of reading passages and paragraphs commonly found on the COMPASS. We also discuss the role of signal words and ideas in giving shape to those patterns. Two very helpful signal word websites: http://lincs.ed.gov/readingprofiles/S... and http://www.somers.k12.ny.us/intranet/.... The sample questions in this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... NOTE: This video series is not licensed or endorsed by ACT and is strictly for educational purposes only.
