Intro to Grammar: Solving the Puzzle, Day Two
Uploaded on Jun 10, 2011
This is part two in our Introduction to Grammar video series for the Summer 2011 Intensive English Program. In this video we begin looking at the basic profiles of each of the major parts of speech and the relationships that they have with each other. Transcript to Introduction: "Think about the first time you put a puzzle together. Do you remember the experience of looking at the cover of the box to see the finished product? Perhaps you were excited, because you could see the goal ahead of you, and how beautiful that final, completed puzzle would appear. But then... you opened the box. At first you were fascinated, and even curious. How could all of these tiny pieces fit together to form... that picture of an ocean, or of these kitty cats, or even of this famous painting. You wondered how long it would even take you. Time would pass...and then fascination turned to frustration. The pieces were so small, and most of the time they wouldn't even fit together! Hours turned into days, and you began to lose hope. Maybe you even asked for a little help... In many ways, understanding the ideas of language is very much like solving a puzzle. We have some notion of the finished product, but also lots of difficulty in fitting the pieces. In Part Two of our video series, we will look begin looking at these pieces of language, and hopefully by the time we're finished, you'll begin to see how it can all come together. Welcome to an Introduction to Grammar. "
