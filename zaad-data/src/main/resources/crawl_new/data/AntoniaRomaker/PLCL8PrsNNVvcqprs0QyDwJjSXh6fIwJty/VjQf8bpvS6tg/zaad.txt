#70 Russian grammar - Dative case: give, help, need, I am 18, I am cold...
Published on Oct 30, 2014
In this video lesson I will talk about the Dative case of the Russian language. First we'll surf through the situations in which we are supposed to use this case and then see how words change their forms when they are put in Dative!
