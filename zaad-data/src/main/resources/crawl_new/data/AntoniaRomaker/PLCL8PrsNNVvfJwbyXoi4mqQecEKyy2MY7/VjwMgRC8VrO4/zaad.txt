Published on Apr 23, 2014
We keep studying Russian verbs! We learn how they change their forms and also find out hiw they are different in meaning. To day we will take a closer look at "????????", "?????????????", "????????", which can be quite confusing! English too! English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday!
