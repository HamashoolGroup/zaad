Published on Dec 22, 2014
Russian wedding is a very interesting one! We have some unusual traditions of ours and if you want to understand Russian more - you need to watch this video! It will be useful for almost all levels! So enjoy ;) p.s. Sorry for being away, I had to deal with some health problems, now everything is ok and I'll get back on my feet and back in my schedule. Just need time. Soon, in a couple of days, I'll post the next English video! Love you, guys! My channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniaRo...
