?82 English vocabulary: rise, raise, arise, erase - what's the difference, how to choose
Published on Oct 27, 2014
All these four verbs (rise, raise, arise, erase) sound more or less similar and two of them - rise and raise - have a very similar meaning! So we need to clear things out - in this class we will focus on the difference between rise and raise and in part two we'll talk about the rest. English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday!
