SeriesEnglish Story #1
Published on Nov 1, 2012
This is a new branch of my video project - I tell stories about the actors and the series itself, of course I also provide you with some interesting useful phrases from the articles I work with. So the plan is: 1. Introduction. 2. Contenct (a story). 3. Useful language. My group - http://vk.com/club42915622 My channel - http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ETe...
