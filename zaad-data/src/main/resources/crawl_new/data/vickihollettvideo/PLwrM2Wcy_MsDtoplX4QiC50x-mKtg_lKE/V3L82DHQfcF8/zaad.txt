Ground Control to Major Tom - Space Oddity - David Bowie - Subtitles
Published on Jan 11, 2016
Here's a David Bowie classic that my students have enjoyed - hope you will too. The copyright on the music has been cleared by YouTube, so feel free to share it with your students. RIP David Bowie - what a great story teller and what a great musician. Planet earth is blue without you.
