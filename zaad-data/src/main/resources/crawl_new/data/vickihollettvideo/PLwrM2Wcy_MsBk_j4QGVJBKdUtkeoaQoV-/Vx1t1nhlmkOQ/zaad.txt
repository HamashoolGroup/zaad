Running up the art museum steps Rocky-style is a must for any visitors to Philadelphia This video is a remix. I do not have permission to publish this music which is "Gonna Fly Now", also known as "theme from Rocky". It was composed by Bill Conti, with lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. It is available for purchase from: Google Play, iTunes and AmazonMP3 It also includes a brief extract from the original Rocky movie with the famous line: "Yo Adrienne, I did it" All the video is mine and I hope the audio copyright holder will allow me to keep this posted. Many thanks. The original movie scene can be seen here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NubH5B... Check out my blog for more information on this video: http://www.vickihollett.com/?p=4225
