Published on May 29, 2013
You can see this video with a clickable transcript at my video website: http://www.simpleEnglishvideos.com/la... I'm an English teacher and I've made this video because sometimes my students find these words confusing, particularly 'at last' and 'lastly'. Let me know if you like it and would like me to make more video lessons. Also, what words, phrases or features of English would you like me to make a video about? Leave a message in the comments, or send me a video response. I'll be sure to watch it. And don't forget to visit my video website - Simple English Videos dot com. http://www.simpleEnglishvideos.com. It has stacks of cool movie trailers with free clickable transcripts. Follow me on twitter @VickiVideos so you don't miss out on future videos and subscribe to my YouTube channel.
