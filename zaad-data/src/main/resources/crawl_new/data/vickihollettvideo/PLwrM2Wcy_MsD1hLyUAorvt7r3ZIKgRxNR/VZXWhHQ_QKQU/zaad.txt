To see the first one, click here: http://youtu.be/eosNZiwEslo Many thanks to Zehra, Zeynep and Jason R Levine for helping us make this video.

I'm an English teacher and I've made the videos because sometimes my students find these phrases confusing. Let me know if you like them and would like me to make more video lessons. Also, what words, phrases or features of English would you like me to make a video about? Leave a message in the comments, or send me a video response. I'll be sure to watch it.
