SoundCloud - http://bit.ly/1nKIAHp Welcome to 30 Days of English! Let me first say that I am so excited to have you here. I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 16, we are talking about pronunciation of words that end in -ate. They are different if they are a verb or a noun/adjective. Enjoy! _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different. My goal is to bring you constant education in a practical and entertaining way. Just click "CC" if you need to read along as I speak.
