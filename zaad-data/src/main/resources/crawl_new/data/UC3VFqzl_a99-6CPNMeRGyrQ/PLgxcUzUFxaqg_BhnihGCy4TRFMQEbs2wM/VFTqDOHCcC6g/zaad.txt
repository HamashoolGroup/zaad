I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 11, we are talking about the English pronunciation of the many words that have a silent second syllable. So many words with three or more syllables in English we'll will make the second syllable silent so that it is easier to say. This will make you sound like a native English speaker for sure! Enjoy :) _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different. My goal is to bring you constant education in a practical and entertaining way.
