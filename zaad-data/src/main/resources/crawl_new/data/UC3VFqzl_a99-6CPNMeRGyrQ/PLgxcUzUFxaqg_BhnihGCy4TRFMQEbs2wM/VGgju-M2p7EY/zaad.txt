I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 10, we are talking English sentence word order, specifically verb and object placement. I know this sound like a lot of boring grammar, but I think it will be easier than you think. Let's get going! Enjoy :) _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different.
