Lyrics- Five little monkeys jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped his head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" Four little monkeys jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped her head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" Three little monkeys jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped his head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" Two little monkeys jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped her head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" One little monkey jumping on the bed. He fell off and bumped his head. Mama called the doctor and the doctor said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" ? No little monkeys jumping on the bed. They fell asleep while laying their heads. Doctor called mama and mama said, Hello? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" ? "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!" ?
