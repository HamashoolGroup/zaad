Lyrics: This old man, he played one; He played knick-knack on my thumb. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played two; He played knick-knack on my shoe. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played three; He played knick-knack on my knee. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played four; He played knick-knack on my door. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played five; He played knick-knack on my hive. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played six; He played knick-knack on my sticks. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played seven; He played knick-knack up in heaven. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played eight; He played knick-knack on my gate. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone, This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played nine; He played knick-knack on my spine. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone. This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played ten; He played knick-knack once again. With a knick-knack, paddy whack, Give a dog a bone. This old man came rolling home.
