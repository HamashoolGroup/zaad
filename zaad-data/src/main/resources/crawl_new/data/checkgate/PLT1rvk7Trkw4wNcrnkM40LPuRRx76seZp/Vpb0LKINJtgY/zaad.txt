Lyrics: Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And Everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go He followed her to school one day School one day, school one day He followed her to school one day Which was against the rule It made the children laugh and play Laugh and play, laugh and play It made the children laugh and play To see a lamb at school So the teacher turned him out Turned him out, turned him out So the teacher turned him out But still he lingered near And he waited patiently Patiently, patiently And he waited patiently Till Mary did appear Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go Please subscribe to our channel for our latest videos. http://www.youtube.com/user/checkgate...
