Lyrics: There were ten in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were nine in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were eight in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were seven in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were six in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were five in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were four in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were three in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There were two in the bed And the little one said "Roll over, roll over" So they all rolled over And one fell out There was one in the bed And the little one said ?I?m all alone, now I miss my friends.? There was one in the bed And the little one said ?Come over, Come over? So they all climbed over and all felt good. Good night, good night.
