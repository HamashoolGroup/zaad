Lyrics: All around the cobbler?s bench, the monkey chased the weasel. The monkey thought ?twas all in fun, Pop! goes the weasel. I?ve no time to wait and sigh no patience to wait ?till by and by, kiss me quick, I?m off, goodbye! Pop! goes the weasel. A penny for a spool of thread, A penny for a needle. That's the way the money goes. Pop! goes the weasel. You may try to sew and sew, and never make something regal, So roll it up and let it go, Pop! goes the weasel. All around the cobbler?s bench, the monkey chased the weasel. The monkey thought ?twas all in fun, Pop! goes the weasel. Pop! goes the weasel.
