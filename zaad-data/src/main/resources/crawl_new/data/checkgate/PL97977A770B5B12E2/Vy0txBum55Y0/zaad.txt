ABC Song from the series ABCD 2 Songs. This fully comprehensive HD version of our famous alphabet song, "ABC Song with Cute Ending", accommodates both upper and lower-case letters of the alphabet. We encourage active participation and engagement by having recorded children read along to each inflating alphabet balloon. We have slowed down the speed of the song and pronounced each letter very clearly for children to easily sing along to each letter. Check out the rest of our educational videos that are directed toward little minds! http://abckidtv-shop.spreadshirt.com/ Lyrics : Let's inflate ABC Balloons!
