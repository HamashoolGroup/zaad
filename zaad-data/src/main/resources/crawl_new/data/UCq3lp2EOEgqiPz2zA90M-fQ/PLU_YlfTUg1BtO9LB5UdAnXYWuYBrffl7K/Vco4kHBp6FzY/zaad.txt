Learn English through stories (Level 1): The Collector Peter Viney
Published on Sep 3, 2015
It?s August 1st, 1993 today. The twentieth-century film Jurassic Park is in the cinemas this week. It?s a new film, and the pictures of dinosaurs are on everything. They?re on packets of cornflakes, magazines, comics. All these packets here have got the Star Trek picture. But I need packet with dinosaur picture. I can get 300,000 units for that packet at home. The dinosaur picture on that packet is by Kate Hermann. She?s a very famous artist at home. Many people collect food packets with her pictures on them, but they haven?t got the dinosaur picture. No one has got that picture. Kate Hermann?s picture is famous, because the colours of the dinosaurs are correct. Dinosaur pictures usually have all the colours wrong.
