What is necessary to learn English well?
Published on Mar 19, 2016
Imagine you can talk to native speakers just like you talk in your first language. Imagine other people wanting to speak English as well as you do. Probably the most important way to improve your motivation is to use English. It is simply very enjoyable to use your English to read a good book, understand a song, watch an interesting movie, get an answer to a computer problem, exchange e-mails with a native speaker, etc. The more you use English, the more you will want to use it .
