Uploaded on Aug 31, 2011
Pronunciation and Fluency Class at ABILITY English. When you are trying to speak in a second language and people don't understand you it can be very embarrassing and frustrating. At ABILITY Education we believe good pronunciation is very important. When you learn how pronunciation works you improve your listening and increase your fluency. We teach pronunciation and fluency skills using the PRON method. The method is exclusive to ABILITY English and we give our teachers specialised expert training only available here.
