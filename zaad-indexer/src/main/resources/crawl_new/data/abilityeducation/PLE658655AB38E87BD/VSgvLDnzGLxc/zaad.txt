How ABILITY?s Pronunciation & Fluency Course works
Published on Oct 21, 2014
This short video demonstrates how our Pronunciation & Fluency English course works. The English Pronunciation course focuses on typical mistakes made by different nationalities. The teachers help train students on how to use their tongue, mouth muscles, lips, teeth and jaws to make the correct sound. Our teachers work individually with students in order to help them correct target sounds. Teachers speak at native speed regardless of current English level which pushes all students to a better understanding of spoken English. Students are taught how to model native English speakers through recordings, videos and songs all of which help our students greatly in overcoming their fear of speaking in public as well as significantly helping them to understand other native English speakers they may encounter on their journey to fluency.
