International Business class at Taronga Zoo
Published on Jul 10, 2013
On July 2 2013, the International Business class from Ability English in Sydney went on a field study trip to wonderful Taronga Zoo, which is on the shores of Sydney Harbour. Our purpose was to use our knowledge from our marketing and risk-assessment studies to evaluate their procedures and the facilities for local and international visitors, especially children. We hope you enjoy our homemade production!
