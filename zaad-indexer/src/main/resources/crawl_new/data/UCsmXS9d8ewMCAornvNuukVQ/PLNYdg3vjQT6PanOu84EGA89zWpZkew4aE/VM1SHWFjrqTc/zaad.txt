In addition, American education has a high reputation in college education. -How long will you be staying? -I intend to stay as long as my studies last and this is 4 years for my course of choice. -Where will you be staying? - I intend to stay at the accommodation provided by the university. -Do you have any relatives in the U.S.? -No, but I know lots of people from my hometown who had studied there and when they came back shared their experience with me. -What do you intend to do after your studies? -I intend to return to my hometown and help there by putting my knowledge into practice; In my country the educational system is not ideal especially for learning English, so my dream is to teach English to my people and help them in this way to acquire good knowledge of the language and fulfill their dreams. -Do you have a family? -Yes, I have a big family and they are very supportive. I will certainly miss them during my studies but I will make up for the lost time during the holiday break. -What if you fall in love with an American? What are you going to do? -During my stay I intend to focus only on my studies as this is very important to me, but in case that happens, I would love to introduce her/him to my country, my culture, and my family. I really hope that I will be able to convince him/her to stay with me and help me fulfill my dream which is to be a part and improve the educational system of my country. COPYRIGHT dori-ielts.com.
