IELTS Listening: Tips for Completion tasks and 6-step strategy- english video
Published on Feb 13, 2014
This video describes in detail all the tasks that are similar in logic and strategy to note-completion tasks. These tasks are form-completion, table-completion, and sentence completion. After the examples, a 6-step strategy is proposed that you should follow in order to help you during your IELTS listening practice and preparation. Turn the video to HD to see the examples clearly. Any example used is the result of my own personal work. - You might want to watch the note-completion video first: http://youtu.be/dNgNiNfF3uE Free IELTS preparation: http://www.dori-ielts.com -Share this video: http://youtu.be/PSfQMCRjAlo -Subscribe to my channel for more: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmXS...
