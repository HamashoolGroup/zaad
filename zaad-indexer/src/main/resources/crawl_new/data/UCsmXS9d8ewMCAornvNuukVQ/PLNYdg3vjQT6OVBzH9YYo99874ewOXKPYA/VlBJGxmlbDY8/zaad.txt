Published on Jan 24, 2014
This video is for those of you who have no idea what the IELTS listening section is; what you are asked to do, and how it looks like. I give you general information about it, some examples and some basic tips. http://www.dori-ielts.com Please set the video in HD in order to see the examples clearly. Every exercise I use is the result of my own work. Share this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBJGxm... Subscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmX...
