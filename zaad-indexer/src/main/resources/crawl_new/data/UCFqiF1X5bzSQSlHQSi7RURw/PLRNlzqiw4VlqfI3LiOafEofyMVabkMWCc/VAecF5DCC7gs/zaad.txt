Let Me welcome you to the First Name Game Brought to you by: http://www.RememberNamesBook.com How many times does this happen to you? You meet someone new at a party, networking event, classroom, or at the grocery store and two seconds after you shake hands and introduce each other, you forget that person's name? This used to happen to me all of the time. Then I learned the Key To Memorizing Anything, Quickly! Do you want to know what that Key is to Unlock your own Memory Powers Now? The Key to Memorization is Visualization. If you want to stop forgetting the names of the people that you meet, then follow these three steps to Memorizing and Remembering Names: 1. Location Choose a Feature that stands out on the individual. 2. Visualize Turn the Name into a picture of someone or something that this name reminds you of and have it interact with the location that you chose. Three people that we met were: * Kate - Gate * Penny - Penny (coin) * Chet - Jet 3. Review This is a critical part of the process. If you want to remember their name for a long time, then make sure to review their name. That's It!! Follow Those Steps and you Will Forever Be Known as the Person That Never Forgets and Always Remembers the Names of Everyone that You Meet!! This will help with building Rapport, Building Connections and Relationships with Others, and if you're In Business or are a Professional, then this will help you with obtaining more referrals because that person now feels that you actually care about them!
