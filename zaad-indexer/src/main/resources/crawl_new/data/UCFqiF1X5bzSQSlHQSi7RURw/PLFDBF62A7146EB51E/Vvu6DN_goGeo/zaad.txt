How to Memorize Numbers Part 2 | Pictures 0-9 | Memory Training | USA Memory Championship More Memory Training at: http://www.aemind.com/memorytraining Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/aemindmemory Hey What's Going! I am making this video right now to Show those of you that want to truly improve their memory, focus, and accelerate the rate at which you learn, how to memorize Numbers. I showed you in a previous video how to Use Phonic Sounds from our Body Files in order to create Pictures for Numbers: http://youtu.be/AlxNBTTgZBg If you don't know what Files are, I'll explain right now. Files are essentially places within your mind in which you can store information on there for easy recall and retrieval later on.: http://youtu.be/585Dm2hhQYU We are going to use the Body files that we created in order to be able to translate a Number into a Picture for easy Memorization and Recall. Remember that you need 5 things in order to memorize anything, Focus, File, Picture, Glue, Review In order to be able to memorize a 100 digit number you need to convert the numbers into pictures. Remember that in the USA and World Memory Championship Competitions you need to be able to Memorize and Recall long strings of numbers so this is a good way to start your Memory Training for the competitions. Remember that for the Memory Body Files, We are chose 9 spots from your body and 1 from your environment. Here they are (Make sure to visualize these parts with their given number and name. It is very important for future purposes.. Visualization is KEY!): 0 = Sand 1 = Top (For Top of Head) 2 = Nose 3 = Mouth 4 = Ribs 5 = Liver 6 = Joint (For Hip Joint) 7 = Cap (Knee Cap) 8 = Fibula (For Shin Bone) 9 = Ball (For Ball of Foot) I recommend for you to close your eyes and visualize these files in your mind. It helps to sink it deep into your unconscious mind for faster memorization. Here are the Consonant sounds for each number: 0 = S, Z, C (Soft) 1 = T, D, Th 2 = N 3 = M 4 = R 5 = L 6 = J, Sh, Ch (soft), G (soft) 7 = Ck, K, G (Hard), C (Hard) 8 = F, V 9 = B, P What you have to do next is throw in some vowels when creating a picture for a number. With Single Digits, you need to know one extra principle. Because there is only one consonant sound in single digits, we need to add one thing to the front of each number. I want you to imagine that there is a space right before the single digit number. This space represents the following consonant sound: "H" like "Ha" Now here are the Pictures for the first 10 Numbers from 0-9: 0 = HouSe 1 = HaT 2 = HoNey 3 = HaM 4 = HaiR 5 = HaiL 6 = HaSh (Brown) 7 = HooK 8 = HooF (Bottom of Horse's Leg) 9 = HooP (Hula) I will show you how to take this Technique and turn Every Number from 0-99 into a Picture. So that you can learn these pictures faster, create some flash cards.. Place the number on one side and the picture (from Google Images) on the other. Once we have turned every number into a Picture I will show you how to Memorize Numbers. I'll see you on the Next Video! Keep Pushing Forward! Maximize your Memory and Brain Power!
