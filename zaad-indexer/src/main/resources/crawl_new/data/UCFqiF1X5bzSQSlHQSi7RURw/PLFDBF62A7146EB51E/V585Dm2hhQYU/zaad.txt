Create Body Memory Files | Memory Training to Memorize Numbers | USA Championship Improve your Memory at: http://www.aemind.com/memorytraining Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/aemindmemory Hey What's Going! I am making this video right now to Show those of you that want to truly improve their memory, focus, and accelerate the rate at which you learn, how to create Body Files. I showed you in a previous video how to create House Files. http://youtu.be/mIWsiHSpOh0 If you don't know what Files are, I'll explain right now. Files or Journeys are essentially places/locations within your mind in which you can store information on their for easy recall and retrieval later on. These Body Memory Files are going to be used as a way to later link numbers to a specific picture. Remember that you need 5 things in order to memorize anything, Focus, File, Picture, Glue, Review In order to be able to memorize a 100 digit number you need to convert the numbers into pictures. I'll show you how to do that in later videos. Remember that in the USA Memory Championship and World Memory Championship Competitions you need to be able to Memorize and Recall long strings of numbers so this is a good way to start your Memory Training for the competitions. For these Memory Body Files, We are going to chose 9 spots from your body and 1 from your environment. Here they are (Make sure to visualize these parts with their given number and name. It is very important for future purposes.. Visualization is KEY!): 0 = Sand 1 = Top (For Top of Head) 2 = Nose 3 = Mouth 4 = Ribs 5 = Liver 6 = Joint (For Hip Joint) 7 = Cap (Knee Cap) 8 = Fibula (For Shin Bone) 9 = Ball (For Ball of Foot) Make sure to remember all of these. Keep practicing. Ask your friends and family members to test you through out the day. You should be able to do this forwards and backwards. I recommend for you to close your eyes and visualize these files in your mind. It helps to sink it deep into your unconscious mind for faster memorization. Alright.
