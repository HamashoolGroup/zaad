The Unbearable Lightness of Memory
Published on Feb 3, 2015
It?s the thought of your childhood home. It?s that comforting aroma you can still smell ten years later. It?s the way you define yourself. It?s your memory. Where is memory stored? How do we recall? Why do we forget? We?ll shine a light on these and many other questions about long-term memory from a molecular, psychological, and emotional perspective. The audience discovered how their long-term memories can be naturally twisted, tweaked, and changed, and how memories of the past could also help us peer into the future. We explored the bumpy road even a youthful mind sometimes travels when experiencing d?j? vu, succumbing to suggestibility, or having a ?senior? moment.
