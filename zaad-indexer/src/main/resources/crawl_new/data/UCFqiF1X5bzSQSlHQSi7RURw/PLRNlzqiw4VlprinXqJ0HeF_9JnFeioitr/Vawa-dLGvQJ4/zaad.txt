The key here is to stay relaxed and let your mind visualize or picture what the professor or speaker is teaching you. If you are a high school or college student, Try it out next time that you are in a classroom and you will start seeing your ability to focus on the subject matter go up. You will also notice that you begin to improve your natural memory as you exercise the creative part of your brain, which is your right hemisphere. Stay Up!
