This is Luis Angel, your memory coach with AE Mind! We all know that there are 8 Planets (The ex 9th planet, Pluto, was demoted and is now considered a Dwarf Planet thanks to Neil Degrasse Tyson and other Astrophysicist in the Science Community) in our Solar System. These planets rotate round and round our home star called the Sun. Our Solar System rotates alongside other planetary systems, around a black hole in the Milky Way Galaxy. There are hundreds of billions of these galaxies in our ever expanding Universe! So let's focus back on our 8 planets. How do we remember the order of the rocks floating in space? It's simple. You use the AE Mind Memory System. Step 1. Location Step 2. Visualize Step 3. Review Create locations by imagining that you are walking around your home and choose different spots as storage places. Then you use the following images to help you remember that the planets go in that specific order. 1. Mercury = Element Mercury 2. Venus = Venus Williams or Venus Razor 3. Earth = Globe 4. Mars = Martian 5. Jupiter = Jumping Tar 6. Saturn = Rings 7. Uranus = Your Asparagus 8. Neptune = Nap Tune (Pillow with Headphones) *9. Pluto = Pluto the Dog (remember that this is now considered a Dwarf Planet) Get the Memorize Planets PDF File here: http://www.aemind.com/memorizeplanets Visualize each one of these images along a specific route in your home. 1st Image of Mercury to the 1st location in your home. 2nd one to the 2nd and so on...
