This is Luis Angel, your Memory and Mind Coach. I am currently training to compete in the World Memory Championship that will be held later this year in England. In this first Memory Training Vlog 1, I wanted to talk about getting over the hump that you get when you are attempting to learn a new skill. I am right now attempting some new techniques that will help me be able to Memorize Cards at a very fast pace. This new technique is something that I haven't done before to this extent. I like many people do have my doubts, but all I need to do is look back at my life during different situations, when I felt similar to how I'm feeling right now and see how I got over the hump. You see, We all have those moments. Moments when we ask ourselves, "Is this really going to work?" or "Can I really master this new skill?" Somehow, someway we find something deep within us that just increases our confidence to do the things that we are doubtful of doing. What I want you to do is to share an experience in the past when you had that feeling of doubt about trying something new, and somehow you got the confidence to overcome that fear where the end result ended being positive. Then use that experience as a reference point when you feel that doubt feeling creeping up again when you are either trying to Learn about memory training and how to memorize cards, numbers, names and faces, or anything else. ================ Remember Names ================ Learn How to Remember Names and Faces Quickly Using the Memorize Anything Technique by going to: http://www.aemind.com/names for the Free Names List!
