This is Luis Angel, your Memory and Mind Coach. I am currently training to compete in the World Memory Championship that will be held later this year in England. In today's Video, I wanted to talk to you about how to increase the Ability to be able to Focus, concentrate, and pay attention to the task at hand. One of the things that helped me out greatly was listening to Classical Music. I felt like it just cleaned out my mind and allowed me to think more clearly and creatively after just one day. I stopped essentially entirely listening to the Radio because I was noticing that most of the music on there was garbage. That garbage was polluting my Brain. So I suggest that you try it out for a few days and see if it doesn't help you improve your focus, concentration, and the ability to pay attention after listening to classical music while doing your homework, regular work, or just meditating. Let me know how it works for you down below. Here is a list of my Pandora Playlists to help me focus and pay attention: -Ludwig van Beethoven Radio -Mozart Piano Radio -Relaxation Radio -Meditation -ESP [Deep Relaxation Mix] Radio -New Age Essentials Radio -Calm Meditation Radio -Classical Radio -Symphonic Radio AE Mind Channels: AE Mind Main: http://www.youtube.com/aemind AE Mind Health http://www.youtube.com/aemindhealth AE Mind Memory http://www.youtube.com/aemindmemory AE Mind Money http://www.youtube.com/aemindmoney AE Mind Science http://www.youtube.com/aemindscience Stay Up!
