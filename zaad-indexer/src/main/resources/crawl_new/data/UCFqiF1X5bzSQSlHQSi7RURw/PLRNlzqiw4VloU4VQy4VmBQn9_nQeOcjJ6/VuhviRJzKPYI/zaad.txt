My name is Luis Angel. I am a memory coach with AE Mind. My goal is to help students tap into their full mind's potential so that they can memorize and learn their school material much more quickly. I work with High School, College, and University Students to help them improve their Memory and Ability to Focus through the AE Mind Better Memory Now Workshops! As you saw here, I can help students memorize a long number in a short period of time. This ability to memorize anything quickly, can help them in Math and in every other school subject. Being able to remember what they study in the classroom and at home through their textbooks, books, and from what the teachers taught them, is crucial to long term success in school and in life! The memory techniques that the students will learn will help them in the following school subjects: - Math: Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, etc... - Languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, etc... - Science : Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Medical, Nursing, etc... - Social Sciences: Law, Psychology - History - and much more Students will also see a boost in their scores with their SAT Exams and College Level Exams.
