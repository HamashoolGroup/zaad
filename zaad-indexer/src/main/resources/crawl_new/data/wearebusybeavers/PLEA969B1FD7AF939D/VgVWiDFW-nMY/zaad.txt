SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/YOUTUBE-SUBSCRIBE FREE TEACHING RESOURCES: http://BusyBeavers.com GET THE APP: http://bit.ly/JUKEBOX This Video is a great way to get children speaking in sentences. They have to answer the questions "What's this?" and "What color is the...?" in full sentences. You can make a game out of it. Try pausing the video and have the children tell you what color they think each object will be. Be careful! They get very excited!
