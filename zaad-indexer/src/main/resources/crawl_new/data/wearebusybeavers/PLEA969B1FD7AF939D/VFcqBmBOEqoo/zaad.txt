This is more practice with asking the question "What color is the...?" and answering in a full sentence. The letters F,L,R,V,Z and the "th" sound are difficult for many Asian students to pronounce correctly when they first learn them. This exercise contains many words with those sounds. Listen carefully to students pronunciation. You can watch this whole video by becoming a paying subscriber to our website.
