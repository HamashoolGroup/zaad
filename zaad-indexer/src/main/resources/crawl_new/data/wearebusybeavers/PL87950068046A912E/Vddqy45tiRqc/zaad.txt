Learn Fruit Names - English Kindergarten Education
Uploaded on Nov 7, 2008
Website: http://BusyBeavers.com - Kids English Learning Resources - MP3s, Worksheets, Flash Cards, Games and more! This is the 1st in a 4 video series from Level 2 about food. Learning the names of foods in any language is always important. Plus the phrases "Do you like...?" "Yes, I like...?" and "No, I don't like...?" are great conversation makers. Try this video out and then follow through the series - next "Vegetables and Meats" then "Drinks and Condiments" and finally "Junk Food and Sweets". You can buy this video on a DVD from our online shop.
