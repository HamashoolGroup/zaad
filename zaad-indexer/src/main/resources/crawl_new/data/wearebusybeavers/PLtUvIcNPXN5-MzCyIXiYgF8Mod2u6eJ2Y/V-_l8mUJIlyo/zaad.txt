SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/YOUTUBE-SUBSCRIBE FREE TEACHING RESOURCES: http://BusyBeavers.com GET THE APP: http://bit.ly/JUKEBOX This Lesson from Level 3 of our English Learning Series teaches how to describe ownership of things. The video practices the concepts - "Mine, Yours, His, Hers, Ours and Theirs" with both singular and plural objects. It's great practice for ESL English Students and there is a lot of content in this short video. Follow the models in the Video which ask and answer questions in full sentences about "Whose is it?" Try pausing the video after each question and see if your students can answer in a full sentence before hearing the correct answer. Once students have grasped the concepts and are able to answer in full sentences you can easily expand on this lesson with objects in the classroom. Try holding up objects and asking "Whose Backpack is this?" or even better, have each student ask a question and the person beside him/her answer. Want to try another great English Teaching Video?
