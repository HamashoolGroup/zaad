About to - Bound to: A 90 second video English lesson
Published on Jul 2, 2013
This video was inspired by my son. When he was six, he knew he shouldn't play with matches, so he went behind the curtains to experiment. I was out at the time and the curtains caught fire. Luckily nobody was injured, but the room was black from the smoke. After the firefighters had left Tom looked at the damage. 'Oh no' he said. 'Mummy's bound to notice' You can see this video with a clickable transcript at my video website: http://www.simpleEnglishvideos.com/la... Fed up with using 'will' and 'going to' all the time to talk about the future? Here are a couple of other expressions we often use. Let me know if you like this video and would like me to make more video lessons. Also, what words, phrases or features of English would you like me to make a video about? Leave a message in the comments, or send me a video response. I'll be sure to watch it.
