American Casualties of Drawing
Published on Sep 22, 2013
Gun control is a multi faceted problem and it disturbs me greatly that the discussions about it sometimes seem devoid of statistics. I was very moved this weekend by an art project taking place on the next block. Thank you so much to Peter Quinn (and all the volunteers) for using art to tell a story to flesh out the numbers. For more information on this project, please check out my blog: http://www.merican.vickihollett.com/a... Peter and the volunteers speak fast, but we have posted a version with a clickable transcript at Simple English Videos. http://www.simpleenglishvideos.com/am... Perhaps you wil want to send your students there for homework. "Watch the video and prepare to discuss it in your next class."
