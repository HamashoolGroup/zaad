Do, does and did in questions
Published on Apr 23, 2014
Sixty seconds is a little short, so I've chosen Two Minute English as my new title (length from one to two minutes). This one is about a strange aspect of English: forming questions. We usually form questions with an auxiliary verb (can, must, be, have...), but with verbs like 'goes' and 'went' we use 'do', 'does' and 'did'.
