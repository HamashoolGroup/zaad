Published on Nov 8, 2015
New Series! The video starts with the explanation of the activity, you can skip this by going directly to 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Basically: 1. Intro 2. General Questions 3. Rant 4. Comprehension Questions 4. Rant again 5. Answers. My eye contact with the camera is terrible for some reason, I kept looking at my screens. Will try to sort that out in future videos. A comprehension activity for advanced level C1 students. Here are some relevant links for afterwards: https://www.coursera.org/learn/astrob... - the course on Astrobiology I mention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_p... - the Fermi Paradox on Wikipedia.
