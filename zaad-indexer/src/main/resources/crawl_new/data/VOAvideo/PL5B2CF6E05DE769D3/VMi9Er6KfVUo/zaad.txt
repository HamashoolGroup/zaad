Children Stitch to Save the Planet
Uploaded on Apr 22, 2010
The Climate Quilt Campaign is an international initiative encouraging children around the world to get involved in protecting the environment. Using recycled materials, children from countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America have designed "pledge patches" with promises to work on healing the environment. Recently, thousands of those patches arrived in a small town in Pennsylvania, where volunteers sewed them into a huge quilt. Faiza Elmasry has the story in this report narrated by Carol Pearson.
