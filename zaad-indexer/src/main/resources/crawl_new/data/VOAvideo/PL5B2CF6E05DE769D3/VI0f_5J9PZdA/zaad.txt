Half of Kenyans Self-Medicate
Uploaded on Apr 28, 2010
Experts estimate that half of Kenyans self-medicate when they become ill. Self-medication involves by-passing a doctor to purchase medicines directly from a pharmacy. The practice is particularly prevalent in low-income areas. Most people determine for themselves what is wrong or are diagnosed by those who sell the drugs. And they are often medically unqualified to do so. Drug resistance, under or overdosing and even death are some of the results.Cathy Majtenyi reports for VOA from Nairobi.
