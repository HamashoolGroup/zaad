The Lone Star State?s energy output has been boosted in recent years by development of resources trapped deep below ground in the Eagle Ford shale deposit, which stretches across south central Texas. As VOA?s Greg Flakus reports from Karnes City, Texas, the drop in oil prices has created concerns, but so far has had little impact on the region?s prosperity.
