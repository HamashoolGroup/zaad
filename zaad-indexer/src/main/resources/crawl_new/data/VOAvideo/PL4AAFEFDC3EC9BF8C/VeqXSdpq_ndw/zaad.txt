US Economy Adds 248K Jobs, Unemployment Rate Falls to 5.9%
Published on Oct 3, 2014
Friday?s closely watched report on the U.S. job market saw the economy gain 248,000 jobs in September. Combined with an upward revision of 69,000 more jobs in previous months -- the nation?s unemployment rate fell to a six-year low of 5.9 percent. Both figures were stronger than most economists had predicted. As Mil Arcega reports, though, it also could encourage the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates, sooner than many expected.
