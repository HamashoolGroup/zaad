Garry Kasparov On Why West Must Sustain Economic Sanctions Against Putin Through March 2015
Published on Oct 22, 2014
On this edition of the program, host Carol Castiel, speaks with Garry Kasparov, world-renowned chess champion and pro-democracy activist about Vladimir Putin, a leader Kasparov argues poses more of a threat to international security than any other leading concerns, including ISIL. Kasparov says that Putin's ultimate goal is to undermine NATO and to destroy the institutions that have guaranteed stability in the world since 1945. Kasparov discusses the West's response to Putin's aggression against sovereign states like Ukraine and the Baltics and urges the US and EU to keep pressure on Moscow by maintaining economic sanctions through winter.
