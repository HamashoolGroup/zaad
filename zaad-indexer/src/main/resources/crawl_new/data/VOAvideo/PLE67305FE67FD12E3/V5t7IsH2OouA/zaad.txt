Two Georgetown Professors on Afghanistan
Published on Jan 9, 2013
From the campus of Georgetown University, host Carol Castiel talks with Carol Lancaster, Dean of the School of Foreign Service, and Anthony Clark Arend, Professor of Government and Foreign Service about the myriad challenges -- from Iran, to Syria, to Afghanistan to Southeast Asia -- that face President Obama during his second term. Professors Lancaster and Arend discuss how political gridlock and fiscal constraints at home hamper the US role on the world stage and the extent to which a second-term president has more leeway and leverage in the foreign policy arena.
