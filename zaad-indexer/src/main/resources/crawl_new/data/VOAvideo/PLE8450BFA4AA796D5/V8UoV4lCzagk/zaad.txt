USA Men's Basketball on a Mission at Olympics
Uploaded on Aug 11, 2008
The U.S. men's Olympic basketball team is hoping to make up for its disappointing third place finish at the Athens Games four years ago. That was the first time since professionals were allowed into the Olympics in 1992 that the United States had not won the gold. USA basketball officials refocused their efforts by putting together a star-studded group of NBA players and a big-name coach for the Beijing Games. VOA Sports Editor Parke Brewer visited one of their practices in Beijing before their opening match against host China on Sunday.
