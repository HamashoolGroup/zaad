Alternative Football Tournament to Coincide with South Africa World Cup
Uploaded on Apr 9, 2010
As part of preparations for the football World Cup in South Africa, officials recently inaugurated a refurbished sports stadium in one of Johannesburg's least wealthy neighborhoods. During the World Cup the 3,000-seat facility will host an alternative football tournament for disadvantaged young people from around the world. It is part of a program called Football for Hope that seeks to use the popularity of football to enhance social development. VOA's Scott Bobb was there and has this report.
