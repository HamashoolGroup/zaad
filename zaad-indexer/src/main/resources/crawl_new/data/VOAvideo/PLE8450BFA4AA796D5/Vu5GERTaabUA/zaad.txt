IOC Wraps Up Evaluation of Chicago Olympics Bid
Uploaded on Apr 10, 2009
The 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia were the last games hosted by the United States. Last year, the International Olympic Committee announced that Chicago, Illinois, is one of four candidates to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Chicago joins Madrid, Tokyo, and Rio De Janeiro, the other remaining contenders. Chicago was the first stop on the IOC's tour of candidate cities. As VOA's Kane Farabaugh reports, members of the IOC Evaluation Commission gave Chicago hope that the games could return to the United States in 2016.
