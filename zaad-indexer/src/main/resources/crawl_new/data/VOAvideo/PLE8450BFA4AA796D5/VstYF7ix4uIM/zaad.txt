US Swimmer Promotes Diversity in his Sport
Uploaded on Aug 14, 2008
When American swimmer Cullen Jones won a gold medal Monday in the thrilling four-by-100 meter freestyle relay in Beijing, he became only the second U.S. Olympic swimming champion of African-American descent [Anthony Ervin was the first, in 2000]. Jones says he hopes his success will boost his personal campaign to promote diversity in the sport and help minorities learn how to swim. VOA Sports Editor Parke Brewer has the story from Beijing.
