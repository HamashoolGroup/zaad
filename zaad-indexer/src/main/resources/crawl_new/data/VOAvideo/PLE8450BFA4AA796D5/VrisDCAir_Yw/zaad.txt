Professional American Football Returns to Britain
Uploaded on Oct 29, 2009
American professional football returned to the heartland of soccer a few days ago, as the New England Patriots faced the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the hallowed turf of London's Wembley stadium. For the third year in a row, a sell-out crowd screamed and enjoyed a piece of true Americana in a regular season contest. For both teams, playing in London was a unique part of their season and both squads were well supported in Britain where television coverage over the years has boosted interest. Tom Rivers reports for VOA.
