California Race Challenges Runners Across 200 Kilometers, Scortching Temperatures
Uploaded on Aug 26, 2009
Each summer, scores of runners from around the world compete in a grueling 200 kilometer race in scorching temperatures across [the western U.S. state of] California. Nearly 90 competitors begin in Death Valley, nearly 90 meters below sea level. Over a period of one, two or even three days, they run uphill, finishing more than 2,400 meters high on Mt. Whitney in the Sierra Nevada. The race is produced by AdventureCorps, Inc., a company that produces what it calls extreme sports events. Rebecca Byerly has the report on two runners with very different motivation and life experiences, who recently completed this race.
