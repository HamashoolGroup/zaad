Cambodia Inaugurates Memorial for Genocide Victims
Published on Mar 26, 2015
On Thursday a memorial was unveiled in Phnom Penh to the thousands of men, women and children who were brought to Cambodia?s notorious S-21 prison between 1975 and 1979, where they were tortured and then executed by Pol Pot?s murderous regime. Although many have welcomed the memorial, one aspect of it has proven controversial. Robert Carmichael reports for VOA from Phnom Penh.
