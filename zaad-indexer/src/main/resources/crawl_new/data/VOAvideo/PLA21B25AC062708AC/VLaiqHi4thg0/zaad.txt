The Jordan River is Dying
Uploaded on May 11, 2009
During his trip to the Middle East, Pope Pope Benedict journeys, to the eastern bank of the River Jordan. Many Christians consider the waters holy and make pilgrimages to the river. It flows from north to south along the border between Jordan and Israel and the occupied territories. The Pope will visit from the Jordanian side. But while the waters might be considered holy, environmentalists say pollutants, massive irrigation withdrawals and an ongoing drought are destroying it. VOA's Mandy Clark visited the River Jordan, accessing it from the Israeli side.
