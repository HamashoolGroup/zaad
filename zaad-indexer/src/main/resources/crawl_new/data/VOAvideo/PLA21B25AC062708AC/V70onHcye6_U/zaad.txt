US Commission Says Nigerian Government Allows Religious Violence
Uploaded on May 4, 2009
A US government commission says it is concerned by Nigeria's inadequate response to persistent violations of religious freedom and ongoing religious violence. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom released its annual report Friday, naming countries it says are "of particular concern" for violations of religious freedom. As VOA's Catherine Cannon reports, in addition to Nigeria and Iraq, 11 other countries are on the list of places where religious freedom is most in jeopardy.
