Iraqi Christians Not Returning to Baghdad
Uploaded on Sep 12, 2008
In Mosul, in northern Iraq, Islamic militants continue to target Christians, forcing them from their homes. Several months ago, an archbishop in Mosul was kidnapped and killed. In Baghdad, after being threatened by insurgents in 2004, thousands of Christians left the Iraqi capital. Many fled to neighboring countries, but others have settled in Iraqi Kurdistan where it is safer. VOA's Deborah Block has the story.
