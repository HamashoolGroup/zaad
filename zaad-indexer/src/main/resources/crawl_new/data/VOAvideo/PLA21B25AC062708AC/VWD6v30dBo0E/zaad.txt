Britain Prepares for Pope's Visit
Uploaded on Sep 14, 2010
Pope Benedict arrives in Britain on Thursday for a four-day visit. It's only the second papal visit to the country since the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century and the first state visit. The largest religion in Britain is the Church of England. Catholics are a minority. Tens of thousands of Catholic pilgrims are preparing to attend the Pope's events. But thousands of protesters plan to march against the visit. Henry Ridgwell is in London as the city gears up for the Pope's tour.
