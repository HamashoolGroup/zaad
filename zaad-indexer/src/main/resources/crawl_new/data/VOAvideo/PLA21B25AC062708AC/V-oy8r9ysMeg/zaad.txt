Church Promotes Alternative to Female Circumcision
Uploaded on Jul 13, 2009
Female genital cutting, or circumcision, is rampant in parts of Kenya. The procedure involves removing part or all of the external female genitalia and is typically performed on girls as a rite of passage into womanhood. Critics describe it as female genital mutilation, or FGM. In the town of Meru, Eastern province, the Catholic Church has come up with an alternative rite of passage for girls and young women. Cathy Majtenyi reports for VOA from Meru.
