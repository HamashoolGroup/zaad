Independent Churches Spread in Kenya
Uploaded on Nov 19, 2008
The number of independent churches is growing in many parts of Kenya, especially in low-income areas. These are usually started by people who promise healing, salvation and other rewards, often in exchange for money. With names such as the Maximum Miracle Centre and Winner's Chapel, these churches draw people who used to belong to mainstream congregations. Cathy Majtenyi files this report for VOA.
