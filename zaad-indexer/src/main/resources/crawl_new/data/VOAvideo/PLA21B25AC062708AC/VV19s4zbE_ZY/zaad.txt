British Museum Brings a Bit of South Africa to Central London
Uploaded on Aug 9, 2010
The British Museum has brought a bit of South Africa to central London with an African landscaped garden in front of the Museum. The plants were brought from South Africa's Cape region by ship and include a quiver tree and poker plants. The garden took four weeks to build and is thriving in London's fog.
