Iranian Terror Suspect Known in Texas as Mentally Disorganized
Uploaded on Oct 17, 2011
Manssor Arbabsiar, the man the U.S. government has charged with taking part in a plot with Iranian government officials to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, lived for more than two decades in Corpus Christi, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico, before moving to a suburb near Austin, the Texas capital, a few years ago. In Austin, few people knew him, while in Corpus Christi, Arbabsiar had several close friends and business associates. But, as VOA's Greg Flakus reports, they describe him as mentally disorganized and question his ability to carry out any kind of plot.
