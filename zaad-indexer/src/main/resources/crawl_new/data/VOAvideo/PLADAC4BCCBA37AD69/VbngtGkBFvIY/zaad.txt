Uploaded on Jul 27, 2011
This year's holy month of Ramadan starts early next week and for Egyptians, it will be the first since the revolution in January and February ousted then-President Hosni Mubarak. It is a busy time as families rush to get ready for the nightly fast-breaking meal, the Iftar, which traditionally includes lots of food and especially sweets. Several people take time, though, to talk about the significance of celebrating Ramadan now that Mubarak is no longer president.
