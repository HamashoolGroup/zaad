Sierra Leonean in US Sends Medical Supplies Home to Combat Ebola
Published on Nov 26, 2014

To give back, three years ago Smith began a small volunteer organization, Hope for Lives in Sierra Leone, to help the disadvantaged in his homeland -- one of the poorest countries in the world. As VOA?s Deborah Block reports, he now is sending medical supplies to help combat Ebola, which continues to devastate Sierra Leone. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/si...
