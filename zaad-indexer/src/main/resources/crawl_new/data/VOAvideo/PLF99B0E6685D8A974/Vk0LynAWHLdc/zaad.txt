Trial of Former Chadian Leader to Resume Monday
Published on Sep 2, 2015
The trial of former Chadian president Hissene Habre, which opened July 20 but was postponed two days later to enable his court-appointed lawyers to prepare his defense, will resume September 7 in Senegal. Habre is accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture between 1982 and 1990. But he insists the special tribunal set up for his trial is illegal. Mariama Diallo reports.
