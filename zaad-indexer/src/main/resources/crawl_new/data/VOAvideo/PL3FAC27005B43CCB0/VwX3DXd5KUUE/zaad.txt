Dozens of US Theaters to Show 'The Interview'
Published on Dec 23, 2014

The studio withdrew the comedy from release last week after major theater chains refused to show it. As Mike O?Sullivan reports, the story continues to unfold like a movie with a complicated plot line. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/so...
