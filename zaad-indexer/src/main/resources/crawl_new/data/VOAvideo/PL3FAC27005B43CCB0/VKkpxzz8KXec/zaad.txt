Veteran Blues Singer Trudy Lynn Loves to Collaborate
Published on Dec 17, 2014
Since the 1960s, Trudy Lynn has been singing the blues, sometimes with well-known performers like Ike and Tina Turner. A couple of months ago, she hit the top of the Billboard Blues Chart with the CD ?Royal Oaks Blues Caf?,? which she recorded with harmonica player Steve Krase in her hometown of Houston, Texas. They also went on the road, performing around the U.S. in Switzerland. VOA?s Greg Flakus recently spoke to them in Houston about their musical collaboration.
