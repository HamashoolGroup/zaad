Family Keeps Jousting in Four Generations
Published on Oct 11, 2014
Jousting - in which mounted knights tried to unhorse an opponent with a lance - was a widely popular sport in medieval Europe, and more than 700 years later is still practiced by people all over the U.S. Some go all in for period costume, but many others enjoy it as a family sport in a more recreational way. VOA?s June Soh introduces us to a family of jousters in the eastern U.S. state of Maryland that has kept the tradition alive for generations. Carol Pearson narrates.
