A new hands-on film project is helping American soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD - a mental health condition caused by the violence of war. With the Veterans Day holiday approaching on November 11, VOA's Bernard Shusman reports from New York on how the project helps soldiers heal by sharing their experience with friends, family and fellow soldiers.
