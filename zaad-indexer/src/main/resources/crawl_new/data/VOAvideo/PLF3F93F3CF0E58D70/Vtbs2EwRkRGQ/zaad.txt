Published on Feb 3, 2015

One of the region's pioneers in water conservation is a city you might not expect. Las Vegas is best known for excess. But VOA?s Steve Baragona says the city has cut its water use by a third, without giving up its flamboyant ways. It?s the second in a five-part series on water in the desert Southwest.
