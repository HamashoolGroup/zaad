Human Trafficking Plagues Houston
Published on Apr 22, 2015
Authorities worldwide are fighting human trafficking rings that exploit migrants and force young women into prostitution. The U.S. Justice Department estimates that one in four women trafficked in the United States passes through Houston, Texas, at some point because it is an international and domestic crossroads and a center of commerce. Most are from Asia or Latin America, but, as VOA?s Greg Flakus reports from Houston, some are U.S. citizens. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/27...
