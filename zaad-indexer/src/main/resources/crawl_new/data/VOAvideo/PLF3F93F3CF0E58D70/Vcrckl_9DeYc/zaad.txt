Reenactments Mark 150th Anniversary of US Civil War?s End
Published on Apr 13, 2015
In Appomattox, Virginia, reenactments marked a surrender that many historians believe effectively ended the U.S. Civil War 150 years ago. From 1861 to 1865, the Northern states - the Union - fought the South - the Confederacy, which had seceded from the Union over several issues, including slavery. After the Confederate troops were cornered by Union forces at Appomattox, the Confederate commander surrendered to the Union general. VOA?s Deborah Block was in Appomattox for the anniversary.
