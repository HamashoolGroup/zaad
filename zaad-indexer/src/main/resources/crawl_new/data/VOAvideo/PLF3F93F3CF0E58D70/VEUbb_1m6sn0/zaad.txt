Volunteers Pull Together to Aid Baltimore Riot Victims
Published on May 4, 2015
Calm has returned to Baltimore, Maryland, after authorities lifted an overnight curfew imposed almost a week ago to stem the rioting that followed the funeral of Freddie Gray - the 25-year-old black man who died of spinal injuries suffered while in police custody. Six police officers, three of them African-American, have been charged in connection with his death. Baltimore is now trying to get back to normal, in part with the help of volunteers who responded to calls to help those in the city's riot-torn neighborhoods. VOA's Chris Simkins introduces us to some of those volunteers. Originally published at - http://www.voanews.com/media/video/27...
