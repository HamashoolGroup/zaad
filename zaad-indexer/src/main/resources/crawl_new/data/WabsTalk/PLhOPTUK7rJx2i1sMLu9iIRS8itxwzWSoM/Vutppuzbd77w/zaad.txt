Mani: Only for two hours! Your exams are drawing near. You must study for at least 4 hours daily to get good marks. If you fail I shall stop giving you pocket money. Father will also punish you. Ravi: I feel problem in Maths and English. Mani: Why didn't you tell about it earlier? I would have arranged a tutor for you. You read in 10th class. Do you know how tough the examination is? What will you do now? Ravi: Please pardon me brother. I am at fault. I shall act upon your advice. Henceforth I will study 4-5 hours daily. Mani: I advised you many times but you never took it seriously. You promise, then you forget. If you fail in 10th class exams father will make you work in a factory. You already know it. Now you are not a child. Understand your responsibilities. Ravi: I am really sorry brother. I assure you I'll really work very hard now. Would you please arrange a tutor for me? Mani: Only 40 days are left. Who will teach you now? Work hard yourself. I'll teach you for one hour daily from 9 to10 at night. Ravi: Thank you brother. It is 9.15 brother. Will you teach me today? Mani: Certainly. Bring your books. Ravi: OK
