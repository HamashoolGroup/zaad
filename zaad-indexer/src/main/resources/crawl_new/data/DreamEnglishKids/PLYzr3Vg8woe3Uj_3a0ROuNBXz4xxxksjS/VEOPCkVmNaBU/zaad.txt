New Lullaby Song: http://youtu.be/qM1Bg6jKjxo About the slow l,m,n,o,p: I teach young learners of English as a foreign language, and have found this way the most effective for teaching the letters. If you would like to see another version with the fast l,m,n,o,p please let me know in the comments. Thanks! Try to make the letters out of modeling clay! See below for more teaching tips. Zed version here: http://youtu.be/WGhaYDMhxx8 Song arrangement: Matt R. Copyright 2012 Video by Dream English Copyright 2012 http://www.dreamenglish.com Teaching tips: Watch the video a few times. Pause the video at certain points and ask the students to identify the letters. In the second part of the song, ask the students to match the big letter on the screen with the smaller letters on the bottom. Happy singing! -Matt Support Dream English!
