ABC Songs Collection Learn the Alphabet and Phonics | Kids, Babies, Toddlers
Published on Mar 16, 2014
Learn the ABCs in this fun collection of the most popular Dream English Kids ABC Songs and Phonics Videos. Learn 26 words that begin with each letter of the alphabet. About the slow L M N O P in the ABC Songs: While learning the alphabet we have found that teaching the letters slowly and individually helps with letter recognition and pronunciation. Once students have mastered each letter, they can go on to properly sing the traditional ABC Song with the faster letters. All rights reserved. Support Dream English!
