Paul Bunyan, An American Folk Tale
Published on Feb 13, 2015
Today we tell a traditional American story called a ?tall tale.? A tall tale is a story about a person who is larger than life. The descriptions in the story are exaggerated ? much greater than in real life. This makes the story funny. Long ago, the people who settled in undeveloped areas in America first told tall tales. After a hard day?s work, people gathered to tell each other funny stories. Each group of workers had its own tall tale hero. Paul Bunyan was a hero of North America?s lumberjacks, the workers who cut down trees. He was known for his strength, speed and skill.
