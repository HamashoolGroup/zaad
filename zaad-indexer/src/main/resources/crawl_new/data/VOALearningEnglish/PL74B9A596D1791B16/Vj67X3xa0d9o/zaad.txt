Learning Teamwork in a Kids Band
Published on Nov 21, 2012
Bach to Rock is a music school in the Washington, DC area. It operates a summer day camp in Bethesda, Maryland. Some campers are playing drums and bass. Others play guitar. And others are busy creating music. This group is recording its song "Alcatraz." Brian Gross is the head of Bach to Rock. BRIAN GROSS: "The majority of the students here have never played an instrument before. And in their one-week stay with us, they will have learned, recorded, and performed two songs by week's end." Carly Glazier says her son Grant learns about a lot more than music at the camp. CARLY GLAZIER: "Biggest thing is he's learning how to work together as a team, because when he's taking lessons during the year without a band, he's only learning between he and his teacher, and he's not performing with other counterparts and learning how to put it all together, which I think is a really, really important value that you just can't get in a regular, one-on-one lesson." Lisa London is the mother of camper Ben London. LISA LONDON: "It's almost like a team sport. You get all the benefits of a team sport from being in a band." Brian Gross says Bach to Rock is growing. BRIAN GROSS: "Eventually I actually see this as an international concept. The wonderful thing about music is it's not language-restrictive, so we can teach music in China just as easily as we can teach it here in Bethesda." I'm Shirley Griffith.
