Women in the Navy: Aboard an Aircraft Carrier
Published on Apr 16, 2012
From http://voaspecialenglish.com | http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish The United States Department of Defense has announced plans to open 14,000 more military positions to women. Lieutenant Megan Donnelly is one of the 770 women on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. LT. MEGAN DONNELLY: "Managing 15 - 20 people on the bridge at a time, and it's my job to manage all of them for the captain so that he doesn't have to -- he can focus on the big picture." Lieutenant Donnelly studied at the United States Naval Academy. She was trained as a Navy pilot. She has won a Navy award for her leadership. In fact, she was the first woman on her ship to earn the honor. Lieutenant Nicole Rosales is the ship's only female doctor. She likes the Navy. LT. NICOLE ROSALES: "Not only did they pay for my medical school, but they offered me the opportunity to serve on a aircraft carrier and to serve in various different hospitals throughout the United States." Many women serving on the Abraham Lincoln joined the Navy as a way to support their families. Amber Mentzer wants to save money during her four-year term of service and then leave the Navy, but not because she is unhappy. PETTY OFFICER AMBER MENTZER: "You come in with a positive attitude and do what you need to do, you'll be fine. So, I don't have a problem with the workloads or anything. Everybody gets treated pretty equally." Ingry Pimentel plans to stay in the Navy. SEAMAN APPRENTICE INGRY PIMENTEL: "I am gonna stay in the Navy -- makin' a career out of it. I've been in for about 8 months now. So, I plan a career out of it so far ... I like it." I'm Kelly Knuxoll.
