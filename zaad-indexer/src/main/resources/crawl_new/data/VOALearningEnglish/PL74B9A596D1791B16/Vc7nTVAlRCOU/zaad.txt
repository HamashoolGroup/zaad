Teen Summer: Coco's Story
Published on Sep 4, 2012
Interview by Caty Weaver COCO: "I'm Coco." CW: "Coco? Well, that's really a cute name. Were you named after Coco Chanel [the fashion designer]?" COCO: "My full name is actually Cordelia. It's just a shorter version for me." CW: "And what made you want to work at a theater camp?" COCO: "I've actually been attending this theater camp since I was three years old. So it's kind of a tradition for me to come back, and I love working with kids." CW: "And are you interested in a future in the theater?" COCO: "Yes, on the more tech side. At my school I do a lot with that." CW: "And what is the tech side? COCO: "Building the sets. Hanging lights. If anyone needs a microphone. That kind of thing." CW: "I see. So, if you're a rising tenth grader, you're not probably quite thinking about college yet." COCO: "Not quite yet. I have a basic idea." CW: "Um-huh. Well, thank you so much for talking to us." COCO: "Thank you."
