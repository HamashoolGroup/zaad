A Tablet Computer That Touches You Back
Uploaded on Feb 13, 2012
From http://voaspecialenglish.com | http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish The Consumer Electronics Association holds a show every year in Las Vegas. This year, the show offered everything from dancing robots and singer Justin Bieber to ski-jumpers wearing some kind of technology. The association's Chris Ely says the direction of electronics is clear. CHRIS ELY: "The shift is more towards mobile connected devices. We are seeing an incredible amount of energy and products and volume into products such as tablets, smartphones, e-readers." Senseg spokesman David Rice says his company's tablets feel different. "On the top left we have asphalt which feels very course ... It turns touch-screens into dynamic tactile interfaces. When you touch them, they touch you back." This device, the Blast Chiller by LG, can make a canned drink very cold in just five minutes. It won an award at the Consumer Electronics Show. So did this table, which is a very large tablet computer. I'm Kelly Nuxoll.
