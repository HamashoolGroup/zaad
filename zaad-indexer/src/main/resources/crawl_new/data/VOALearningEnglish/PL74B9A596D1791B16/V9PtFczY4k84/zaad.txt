Comics for the Digital Crowd
Published on Oct 2, 2012
For the past thirty years, Golden Apple Comics in Los Angeles has been selling comic books to adults and children. EVAN CRAY: "I just like holding the pages and reading it." The look of comics has changed little. But store owner Ryan Liebowitz says something new is happening. RYAN LIEBOWITZ: "In the last year or so, we've seen a major transition into digital comic books." Dan Cray likes both traditional comic books and the new versions. DAN CRAY: "I will say there are some comics, like my favorites, that I would, I actually too prefer having a hard copy. But, for a lot of 'em it's just really convenient and really nice to be able to get 'em. I can read them on an iPad, and it's really a convenient format." Chip Mosher works for a company called comiXology. Its online store has over twenty-five thousand comic books. CHIP MOSHER: "For the last six to nine months, we've ranked as the top grossing iPad app in the entire iTunes app store." The price of a digital version is about the same as a paper comic book. Ryan Liebowitz now sells digital comics on his store's website. He says people are buying both print and electronic versions. I'm Shirley Griffith.
