Learn the English Phrasal Verb: To Hang Out | Real English Conversations |
Published on Apr 9, 2015
In this video I talk about the English phrasal verb: hang out. This is a great verb for talking about spending time somewhere, usually with other people. Links to other videos related to this one: 0:23 To spend time (video coming soon) 0:35 To call up (video coming soon) 1:18 To show up (video coming soon) Would you like to learn English phrasal verbs without memorizing a list? We have videos that start by explaining one phrasal verb a story or with many different examples in context so you understand what the phrasal verb means. If we use another phrasal verb in the video, we will provide a link to that video so you can learn that new phrasal verb as well! The goal is that we use phrasal verbs in a natural way, without a planned script in our videos. This way we will only be using common and high frequency phrasal verbs!
