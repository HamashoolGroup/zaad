Published on Mar 22, 2015
Listen to this Real English Expression which is: It slipped my mind. You can use this if you forgot about something and have no good reason to have forgotten. Find us here: You Tube Channel: http://bit.ly/YouTube-RealEng Google Plus: http://bit.ly/g-plus-RealEng Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1se3iRi Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealEnglishConv Blog: http://realenglishconversations.wordp... The Real English Conversations channel on You Tube, our website and our blog have been inspired by our own adventure to learn a second language. They have been created for anyone who is looking to listen to intermediate English audio or Advanced English Audio from a native speaker with an American English accent. All of our conversations are completely unscripted. Your hosts, Amy & Curtis, are from Canada but the Canadian accent and Canadian English is comparable to anyone from the United States from the west coast or the central United States. We want you to hear the natural flow of an English conversation and recognize the differences between written English and real spoken English. All of our real English conversations include a transcription that is available on our website at http://www.realenglishconversations.net/ We realized that most learning resources are BORING which usually leads to loosing motivation to continue to learn English. One of the most effective ways to learn and improve listening comprehension, learn new vocabulary and learn how to use natural English expressions is by listening to interesting dialogues from native speakers. The type of conversation you want to listen to over and over again. Our goal in every audio recording, every blog post and everything on our website is to make learning English fun for you!
