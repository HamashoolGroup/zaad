Hello! Our channel is a happy mix of education and entertainment, from Wattsenglish Ltd. Children starting with English (EFL/ESL) are invited to join Steve and Maggie Magpie in some interactive clips designed to introduce them to learning English in a fun and interesting way. It's super simple to practice English at home with these clips that kids want to watch again and again. The children are exposed to natural English, and readily 'Say with Steve' even after the smallest of encouragement or prompting. So enjoy learning and playing at the same time and please subscribe. You can find free samples of our new Wow! books and other teaching materials at: www.wow-english.com. Steve presents how to teach English to children. + visit our website: www.wattsenglish.com + like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WattsEnglish + follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WattsEnglish
