4 year olds enjoy English classes as well. They don?t think of learning a foreign language, they just enjoy their time in a kindergarten, but at the same time we know, they learn English through games and lots of actions ? they explore the world of English in a natural funny way. You need patience, you need to act out, you can change places in your classroom and you keep doing that every few minutes. This way you get their attention and you can learn so much together.
