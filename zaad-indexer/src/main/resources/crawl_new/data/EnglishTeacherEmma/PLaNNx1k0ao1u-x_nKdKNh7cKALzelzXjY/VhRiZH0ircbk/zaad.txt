http://www.engvid.com/ Watch this lesson to learn about a very common pronunciation mistake. How do you pronounce 'tuba' and 'century'? Is the spelling 'tu' in both words pronounced the same? In this video, I will teach you how and when to pronounce 'tu' like a 'ch' in North American English, we will practice the pronunciation of many words, and we will do some fun tongue-twisters. Don't forget to check out the University of Iowa Library of English site that I mention in this lesson: http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonet... And take the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/pronunciation-tu/
