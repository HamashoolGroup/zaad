Why Don?t I Learn Other Languages By Applying English Harmony Principles?
Published on Nov 26, 2014
In this video I?m responding to Shamil?s question: ?Robby, are you currently learning any new language? It's just you figured out how to efficiently learn English and reach fluency so why stop with only English? Why not apply all your experience with, for example, French? Surely you can apply the same way of learning, techniques and become fluent in French or in any other language in no time.?
