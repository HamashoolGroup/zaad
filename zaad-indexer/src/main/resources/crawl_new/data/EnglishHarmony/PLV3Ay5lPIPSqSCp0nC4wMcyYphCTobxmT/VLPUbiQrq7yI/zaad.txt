English Teacher Puts Skype Student on the Spot? It?s NOT Teaching!
Published on Dec 5, 2014
http://fluencystar.com/ Some English teachers don?t really think about YOUR English development when teaching either in person or via Skype. For example, they would do an introduction of themselves by naming a handful of various things and then ask you to do the same ? which immediately puts you on the spot for the simple reason that you just can?t remember what you?re required to say! Is that proper English teaching?
