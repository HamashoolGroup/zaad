Join Steve live on Peppy Radio Saturday Aprill 11th at 19:00 GMT: http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/46444 Here is my video response regarding Peppy 26. I have finished recording a new song for Peppy 27 and I have finished the script for it. If I have enough time tomorrow, I will film it. I am also planning on starting a Peppy Radio Show. Have a good day ! BTW How do you say Vics Vapor Rub ?
