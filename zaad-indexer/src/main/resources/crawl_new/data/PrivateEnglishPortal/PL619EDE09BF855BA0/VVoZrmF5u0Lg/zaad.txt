free quiz: http://privateenglishportal.com/?p=3244 Well it's time to think about it because the future is coming faster than you think. And why not, we have seen so many technological changes in the past 30 years. Each decade seems to bring us more surprises so I have made this video to get you thinking about the near future, or at least a possible future. You will find many English learning topics in this video. Some to focus on are: time idioms, phrasal verbs and grammar. Please note that some of the expressions are marked informal while others are more formal so that you can have a good mix of formality in English. I recommend you keep a notepad to type or write down all of the new things from the video which you will be able to use in your day-to-day conversation in English. If you have any questions, feel free to post on my Youtube video and I will be more than happy to answer.
