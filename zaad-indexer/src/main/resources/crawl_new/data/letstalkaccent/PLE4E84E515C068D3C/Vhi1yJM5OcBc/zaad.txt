Personality development skills part 08 http;//www.letstalk.co.in Anger Management Skills. We all get angry. It's a normal emotion. However, some of us handle our anger better than others. Anger management is not eliminating anger completely but to control and direct your anger. It is about you controlling the anger before the anger takes control of you. The first step to manage anger is to identify the sources that make you angry. When you are in the middle of a bad situation, it's hard to think logically and rationally, so understanding what causes you being angry can help you plan how to deal with it. Once you know what makes you angry, you can develop strategies for dealing with it.
