TEFL Teachers: TPR Overview - Total Physical Response Theory
Published on Jan 6, 2014
A video about the origins of TPR. The how and why TPR was developed by James Asher and Shirou Kunihira. I originally recorded this video for TEFL teachers at http://XOKenglish.com.br and http://EXLenglish.com It's a short overview talking about how epilepsy led to the understanding of left vs. right brain learning. The use of TPR commands and gestures to allow for greater learning comprehension, a stress-free learning environment, and assimilation of language for fluency and proficiency as set forth by Stephen Krashen.
