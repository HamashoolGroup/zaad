Kinetic typography. Ben E. King - Stand by Me. Lyrics: When the night has come And the land is dark And the moon is the only light we'll see No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid Just as long as you stand, stand by me And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me Stand by me, stand by me If the sky that we look upon Should tumble and fall And the mountains should crumble to the sea I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear Just as long as you stand, stand by me And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah Please comment and rate.
