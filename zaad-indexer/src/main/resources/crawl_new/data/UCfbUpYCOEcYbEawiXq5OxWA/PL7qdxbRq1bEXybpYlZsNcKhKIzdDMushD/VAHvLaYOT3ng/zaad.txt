The Three Little Pigs and Big Bad Wolf | HD Animated Fairy Tales for Children | Full Story Three little pigs is a fairy tale featuring talking animals. This story is about three little pigs, which build home to safeguard them form the Big Bad wolf. The first little pig built his house out of straw because it was the easiest thing to do. The second little pig built his house out of wood. This was a little bit stronger that a straw house. The third little pig built his house out of bricks. The Big bad wolf who learnt that they live separately wishes to eat them up. So he blows the house of straw and wood which forces the first two pigs to take shelter in the brick house. The Big bad wolf tries his best to blow the brick house in vain. The wolf tries in many ways and finally climbs up on the roof and jumps in through a chimney only to fall straight into the kettle of boiling water, which burnt his tail. The first two little pigs build a Brick house for them and they live happily without the fear of the wolf.
