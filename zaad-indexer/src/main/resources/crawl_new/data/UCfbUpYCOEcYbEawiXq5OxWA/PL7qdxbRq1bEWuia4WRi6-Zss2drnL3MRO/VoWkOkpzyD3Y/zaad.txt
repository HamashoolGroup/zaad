Published on Mar 25, 2015
Hi there! Yeah, you ^_^. Thanks for watching! We're happy to share this collection of kids songs and nursery rhymes, starting off with a super simple goodbye song, "After A While, Crocodile." Let us know what you think in the comments ^_^. In case you're wondering, here's a little bit of information about the differences between alligators and crocodiles: - Alligators have u-shaped snouts. - Crocodiles have more v-shaped snouts. - Alligators' upper teeth often show when the mouth is closed. - Crocodiles' upper and lower teeth show when the mouth is closed. - Alligators generally live in fresh water. - Crocodiles generally live in salt water or water that is brackish (has more salt than typical fresh water.) -Neither make very good pets! Here's the lyrics to "After A While, Crocodile": See you later, alligator. After a while, crocodile. Bye bye, butterfly. See you again next time. See you later, alligator. After a while, crocodile.
