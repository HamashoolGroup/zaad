Bringing management training into the Business English classroom
Published on Nov 23, 2012
Steve Flinders of York Associates talking at the 2012 IATEFL BESIG Conference in Stuttgart. Here's what he says about the talk: The boundary between Business English and management training is becoming blurred as BE trainers focus increasingly on the soft skills that professionals working internationally need to get results . How can this approach be translated into activities and materials relevant to learners who already have some experience of working in English? Which management training exercises will work in the BE classroom? In this talk I look at the range of language, communication, intercultural, interpersonal and leadership skills that managers need when they work internationally, and give examples of some activities which can help them develop greater competence in these areas . I draw on material in Leading People, a new title in the International Management English series published by York Associates and Delta Publishing .
