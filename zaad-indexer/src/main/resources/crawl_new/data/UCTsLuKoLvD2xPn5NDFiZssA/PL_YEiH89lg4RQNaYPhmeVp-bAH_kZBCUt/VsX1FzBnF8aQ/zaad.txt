Free Business English lesson. Negotiating in conflict situations
Published on Sep 26, 2013
Here is another Business English Training and Coaching tip. How often are you in difficult negotiations? What can you do to manage conflict? This business English coaching tip gives you 3 ideas. And if you need to improve your Business English vocabulary, I also suggest 3 phrases you can use. This business English video class was inspired by a TED talk I saw which was delivered by William Ury. The talk is called "The walk from no to yes". Ury tells an anecdote which describes very well a typical conflict situation and how it can be resolved. I retell the anecdote here. Hope you enjoy this business English training and coaching tip. Thanks for watching. Mehr Tipps auf http://www.neilcollins.de Neil Collins Business English Training & Coaching Senefelderstra?e 15 Prenzlauer Berg 10437 Berlin
