How can you learn and remember new vocabulary? On my business English courses, students come across a lot of new vocabulary. If they do one 90 minute class a week and regular homework, that might mean seeing 10-15 new words every week. After 10 weeks this could be 100- 150 new words. How can a language learner remember all of these words. In this business English video tip, I will give you two tips on how you can remember vocabulary. Make sure to watch the second part of this video to see the third tip.
