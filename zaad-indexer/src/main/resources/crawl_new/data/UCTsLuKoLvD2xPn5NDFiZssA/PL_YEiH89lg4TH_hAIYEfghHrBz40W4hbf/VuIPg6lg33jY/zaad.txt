Creating an inspirational presentation with Neil Collins, part 2. Business English lesson.
Published on Jan 16, 2014
Here is the second video of a new series on how to create inspirational presentations. Hope you like it! Presentations is a hugely important business English communication skill. So, I recommend spending some time preparing an excellent one. I do a lot of short business English video tips. They are normally about 5-10 minutes long. But this is a business English topic that needs a lot more attention, which is why I'm doing a series of longer videos here. Hope you like them.
