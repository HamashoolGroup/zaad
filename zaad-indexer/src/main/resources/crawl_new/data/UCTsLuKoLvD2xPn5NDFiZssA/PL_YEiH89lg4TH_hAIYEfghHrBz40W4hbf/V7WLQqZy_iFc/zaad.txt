Business English - Making Presentations (Updated)
Published on Oct 16, 2014
A free online English lesson from Oxford Online English. See the full lesson (with notes) here: http://www.oxfordonlineenglish.com/vi... This is an updated version of a lesson I made around a year ago. In the last year, I've worked with many students who needed to learn more about making effective presentations. This has helped me to understand what issues non-native speakers often have when making presentations in English. Making presentations can be difficult in any language, but what if you need to make a presentation in English? In this lesson, we?ll look at some simple advice that non-native English speakers can use to give effective presentations in English.
