A Free Business English Course for you to learn PowerPoint and English together. It's great for any business person who needs to improve his/her English. Go to: http://www.english-quickly.com/esl-ex... for another course that I have with Excel. By the end of this course, you'll learn many business vocabulary words and you'll improve your English pronunciation. Try it out with your own PowerPoint at home! That's the best way to learn English is by doing it. When you go to work, you'll feel like you can speak more confidently. You probably need to be at a pre-intermediate level of English and it's great for advance English students!
