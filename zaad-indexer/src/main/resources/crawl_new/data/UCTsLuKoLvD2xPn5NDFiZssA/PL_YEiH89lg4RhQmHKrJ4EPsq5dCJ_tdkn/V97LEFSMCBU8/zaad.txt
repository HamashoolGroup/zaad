Published on Oct 21, 2015
Did you see J?rgen Klopp's first press conference at Liverpool F.C.? If so, you probably remember his widely reported quote "I'm the normal one." Even if you didn't see the press conference, you may have read Klopp's quote. In this video tip, I'm going to talk about indirect speech or reported speech. This is when you tell someone what another person said. I'll use different sentences from Klopp's interview to explain indirect or reported speech. If you want to talk about the news or what someone said in a meeting, presentation or business lunch, you need to know how to use indirect speech. Watch this video tip to find out how!
