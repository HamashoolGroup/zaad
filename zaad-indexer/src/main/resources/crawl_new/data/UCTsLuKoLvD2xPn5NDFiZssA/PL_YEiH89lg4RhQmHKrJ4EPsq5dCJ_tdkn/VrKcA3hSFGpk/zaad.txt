English lesson. Past simple vs. present perfect to talk about when and how often.
Published on Oct 30, 2013
German speakers of English can sometimes have problems when using the present perfect. If you learn a few rules, it is a lot easier to use these tenses correctly. In this video, Rhea explains one of the big differences between past simple and present perfect. We normally use the past simple to describe an action which is finished. We can say when we did this e.g. last year, last week etc. When we use the present perfect, we don't say when we did this action. We can say how often, but not when.
