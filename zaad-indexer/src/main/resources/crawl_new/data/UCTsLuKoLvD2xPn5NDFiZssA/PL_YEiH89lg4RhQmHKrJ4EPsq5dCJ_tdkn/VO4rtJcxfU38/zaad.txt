Published on Mar 13, 2014
Wie sagt man "doch" auf English? This is a great word in German that can be used as an affirmative answer to a negative statement. In English, there is no one word to say these things. It's not as easy as in German, but it's also not so difficult. Watch the video and I'll explain how you can say this in English. The next time someone says: "We will never speak English fluently." You can say "doch!" in English :-) For more general English or business English tips, make sure to check out our other videos: Business English coaching tip- conflict management: http://youtu.be/Y0vXtsEcaOI Business English presentations tip- starting a presentation: http://youtu.be/FiAPCMBI1Ug Business English presentations tip- ending a presentation: http://youtu.be/RYpMfegATZo Business English grammar tip- uncountable nouns http://youtu.be/-GTYorZwtA8 Business English for negotiations tip- conflict situations http://youtu.be/sX1FzBnF8aQ Business English small talk- telling an anecdote http://youtu.be/oMnSsJfA-dM Business English coaching- storytelling Mehr Information auf http://www.neilcollins.de Neil Collins Business English Training & Coaching Senefelderstra?e 15 Prenzlauer Berg 10437 Berlin
