Logic of English Presentation
Uploaded on Oct 6, 2011
In this video your understanding of English will be transformed! Award-winning author Denise Eide will reveal phonograms and spelling rules which explain 98% of English words. No longer will you need to tell your children, "that is an exception," when they misread or misspell a word. You will learn: 1) The rule which explains the two sounds for C in circus and describes more than 6,000 words! 2) Three of the nine reasons for a Silent Final E. 3) Why we drop the Silent Final E in servicing but not in serviceable. 4) Why many math and science minded kids struggle with reading and spelling. If you have always struggled with spelling or reading, or if you have children who struggle, do not miss this revolutionary video. You will wonder why someone didn't tell you this in kindergarten. As Dr. Robert Sweet, President of the National Right to Read Foundation, declares, "with clarity and simplicity, the solution to America's growing illiteracy problem unfolds."
