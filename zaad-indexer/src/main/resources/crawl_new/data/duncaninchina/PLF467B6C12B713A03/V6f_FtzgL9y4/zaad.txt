Learning English - Lesson Two (Hello/Goodbye)
Uploaded on Jul 12, 2009
In this lesson we look at the many ways to say hello and goodbye. This is the new version of Lesson 2. Thank you to the many people who have said that 'Howdy' is not used as a formal greeting anymore. However, it can be used as an informal one, as a way of greeting a person in a fun and casual way. as I found out for myself !
