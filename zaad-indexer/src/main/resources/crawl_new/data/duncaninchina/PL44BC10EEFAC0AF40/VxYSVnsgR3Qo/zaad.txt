Baotou Winter Wonderland -1
Uploaded on Feb 2, 2008
Snow scenes around Baotou. Filmed in December 2006. Back in the early days of my editing. If you are wondering why the picture seems jumpy, it is because my camera at that time only shot at 17 frames per second. These days my videos are shot at 30fps, thus giving a much smoother and constant picture motion.
