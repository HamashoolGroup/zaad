It felt Like a Kiss (Part 3/4)
Uploaded on Jan 21, 2011
It Felt Like a Kiss' is a film by the award winning documentarian Adam Curtis. This isn't your typical film. Don't expect any narration, timelines, actors or scripts. This is a mind f*ck, and your brain hasn't had it in a while. A pastiche of found footage and iconic pop music, the film weaves together a narrative that has the power to suck you in, chew you up, and spit you out like big league bubble gum. It is deceptively subtle, and highly interpretive. At its root is a manic story of the rise and fall of Americana, through the lens of pop culture, politics and world events. This is for those of you who are both right and left brained. Sometimes nostalgic, sometimes sinister, this isn't a conventional film: it's a trip. It's what would happen to America if she swallowed a heroic dose of mushrooms. Enjoy.
