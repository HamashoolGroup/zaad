St. Mary's Logic of English Pilot Program Video
Published on Jun 10, 2015
Using a professional development grant they received from the Mt. Angel School District, St. Mary's teachers implemented the Logic of English phonics program in 10 classrooms. The results were very promising and they are looking forward to the sustainability of the program for years to come. The Chalkboard Project was very gracious in putting this video together for them.
