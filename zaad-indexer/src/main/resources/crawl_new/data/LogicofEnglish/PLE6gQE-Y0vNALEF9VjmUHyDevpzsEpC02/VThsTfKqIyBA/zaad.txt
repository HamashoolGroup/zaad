Crazy Words Explained 3
Published on Jan 15, 2013
Crazy Words Explained is a collaborative project between Denise Eide of the Logic of English and fourth grade students at Jefferson Elementary School. Each week students wrote words that appear to be exceptions to spelling rules, or words they simply did not understand in terms of why they are read and spelled in a particular manner. Students placed these words in a Crazy Words box, and Denise then selected five words from the box to explain on video. The Crazy Words explained in this video are: plaque, mythology, corpse, immature, and immoral. To learn more about the Logic of English, please visit http://www.logicofenglish.com.
