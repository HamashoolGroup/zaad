Logic of English Teacher Training Course Video Section 1. A full-day training course for teachers, parents, tutors and educators of all types. Section 1: The Problem of English We all have questions about the English language, and it seems there are no answers. We are frustrated by countless exceptions to the spelling rules we have been taught. Believe it or not, about two-thirds of English speakers in America and in the world struggle with spelling or reading in English. The problem of English amounts to a widespread literacy crisis that is impacting all of us. Why? As a culture, we have swallowed the myth that all children will learn to read naturally when they are surrounded by books. We use funny phonics with rules that do not always work; they generate countless exceptions. We need to reform the teaching methods that have been used in reading classrooms in recent decades. The key to reversing our literacy crisis is to understand how our language works. With 26 letters that combine into 74 phonograms representing 45 sounds including 15 vowel sounds, English is undoubtedly complex. But English has rules that explain 98% of our words, without exceptions. These rules work, and they explain how English works. We need to teach smart, providing answers to students' questions and giving them the tools to read and comprehend anything. We need to unify instruction across the grades, across the subjects, in mainstream and remedial classrooms, and at home. There are reliable linguistic answers to our questions about words. English is not illogical! This training video series offers effective solutions, providing hope for all who have struggled.
