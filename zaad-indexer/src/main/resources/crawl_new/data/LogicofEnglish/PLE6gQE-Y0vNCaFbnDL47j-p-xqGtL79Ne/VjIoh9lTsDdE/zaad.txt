Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Section 7.6
Published on Sep 22, 2012
Phonograms and Spelling Rules Part 2, Continued: Softening C and G. Section 7.6 contains perhaps the most useful spelling rule of all. Spelling Rule 1 answers the questions people ask about English in countless examples. It applies to over 16,000 words in English. This rule also occurs in French, Spanish, Italian, and other Latin-based languages. Even visual learners, who typically know how to spell a word because it "looks right," will want to know this rule. Spelling Rule 2, which is similar to Rule 1, explains thousands of additional words.
