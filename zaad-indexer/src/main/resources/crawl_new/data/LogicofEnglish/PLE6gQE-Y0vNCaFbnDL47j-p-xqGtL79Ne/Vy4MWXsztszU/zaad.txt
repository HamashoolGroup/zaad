Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Section 7.1
Published on Sep 22, 2012
Phonograms and Spelling Rules Part 2. In Section 7.1 teachers will experience how the rules and phonograms can aid students in narrowing their options for spelling. Participants will analyze the various spellings of the long /a/ sound and when each occurs. In this way one of the most daunting aspects of learning to spell in English becomes much more manageable and rote memorization is kept to a minimum. Spelling games provide a fun way for students to practice using these phonograms. If you know the options for spelling a sound (such as long "a"), you do not have to abandon the "perfect" word in an essay or presentation, simply because you don't know how to spell it. Spell check becomes an effective tool when you can say, "Well if that isn't right, then it must be this other option." Denise's own spelling abilities improved when she learned about these phonograms, and here she explains how to use them to help your students as well.
