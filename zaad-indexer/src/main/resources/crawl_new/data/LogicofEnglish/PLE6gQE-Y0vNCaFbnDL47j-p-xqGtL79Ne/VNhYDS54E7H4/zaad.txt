Published on Sep 22, 2012
Learning Styles and Learning Differences. In Section 3 Denise Eide unfolds the connection between reading and auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learning. She also encourages educators to consider less traditional learning styles such as logical-literal, intuitive, concrete, and creative. By sharing stories that have impacted her thinking, Denise encourages parents and educators to see the tremendous gifts wrapped up in each student. She then provides ideas on how multi-sensory education can strengthen their weaknesses so that they can live out their gifts to their fullest potential.
