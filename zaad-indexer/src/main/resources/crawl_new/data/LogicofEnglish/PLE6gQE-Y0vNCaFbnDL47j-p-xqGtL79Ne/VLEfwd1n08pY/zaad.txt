Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Section 4
Published on Sep 22, 2012
Handwriting Instruction. In Section 4 Denise Eide provides teachers with a deeper understanding of the essential elements to teaching handwriting and the importance of emphasizing rhythm for developing a fluid, legible hand. She also leads parents and teachers in experiencing what is is like to learn to write by teaching three letters of the Russian alphabet using multi-sensory teaching methods. This presentation will also provide educators with an argument as to why to begin with cursive first, rather than manuscript instruction.
