Published on Sep 22, 2012
Phonograms and Spelling Rules Part 2: Vowels, the CK Phonogram, and Spelling Dictation. In Section 5.2 educators will learn their first multi-letter phonograms. They will also learn the terms short vowel, long vowel, and broad vowel, and how to mark each sound with a dictionary marking. Denise also introduces the concept of "Learning Through Discovery" as a method for teaching students not only the phonograms and spelling rules but how to think critically about language. She then leads viewers to discover the rule that governs the CK phonogram. This section concludes with Spelling List 2 and an opportunity for viewers to practice spelling dictation. It is highly recommended that viewers have a copy of The Logic of English Training Manual when viewing this section.
