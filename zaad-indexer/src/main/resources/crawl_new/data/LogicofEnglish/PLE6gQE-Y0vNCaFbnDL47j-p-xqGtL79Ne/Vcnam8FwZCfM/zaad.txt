Reading & Spelling Teacher Training Section 8

Morphology: The Meaning of Words and Vocabulary Development In this section Denise Eide shows how we can build vocabulary by understanding roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Understanding these building blocks of words will enable students to determine the meaning of new words that they read or encounter in other subjects. With over 2 million words in the English lexicon, understanding how words are built and how they relate is a very important step for vocabulary development. This section provides the rationale for teaching the logic of English across the subjects. To purchase the Training Manual that accompanies this course see: http://www.logicofenglish.com/store/f....
