Published on Sep 22, 2012
Phonograms and Spelling Rules Part 1. In this section Denise Eide begins to detail the spelling rules and phonograms which logically explain 98% of English words. In this section she will introduce educators to all the sounds of A-Z, and the definition of a vowel, consonant, and syllable, which can then be used to scientifically test sounds. She will also teach the first spelling list in the series. In the process she will demonstrate to educators and parents how to introduce reading words with short vowels.
