They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold. ain't means aren't, comprehend, but don't speak it! "isn't easy" means 'is not achieved without effort' "Learning another language isn't easy." 3 Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis each night begins a new day. If you don't understand him and he don't die young, he'll probly just ride away. Texas, the "Lonestar State" has a single star on it's flag and it's often featured on "belt buckles" "Levis" (noun) are "jeans", "probly" is unacceptable for "probably" which means "almost certainly". 4 Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them ole trucks. Let 'em be doctors 'n lawyers 'n such. "pick" (v) means using fingers to play stringed instruments. "ole" (adj) mean old and well-liked. "Ole Jed's son can pick his guitar like a star." 5 Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. They'll never stay home 'n they're always alone, even with someone they love. Verb contractions as. "don't" "they'll" they're are very friendly and acceptable, but " 'n" for "and" and " 'em" for "them" are generally not. 6 Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms 'n clear mountain mornings, little warm puppies 'n children, 'n girls of the night. "pool room" (noun) [poolroom] is a place to play 'pool' - a game on a billiard table. "smokey" is usually spelled 'smoky.' "Willie can be seen at the pool room in the evenings." 7 Them that don't know him won't like him, and them that do, sometimes won't know how to take him. "Them" should be ''Those' (i.e. refers to people) in proper speech. "how to take" means 'how to understand.' "I don't know how to take her." 8 He ain't wrong, he's just different, but his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right. Correcting "ain't" ('isn't', 'aren't') is common by educated US mothers to kids. "pride" (noun) means a 'high degree of self respect.' "John has a lot of pride." 9 Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them ole trucks. Let 'em be doctors 'n lawyers 'n such. "'em" for 'them' is common in fast paced speech. Practice saying the difficult "th" sounds clearly. 10 Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. They'll never stay home 'n they're always alone, even with someone they love. (fade out) Verb contractions, as "don't", are soft & friendly in speech; 'do not' may sound much too serious. 11 Photograph caption: A cowgirl sits on a bale of hay.
