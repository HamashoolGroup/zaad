Always enjoyable programs! - Teacher Frank TRANSCRIPT - ENGLISH GRAMMAR LESSON 21 1 Opposing Connectors: even though, although, though. Also the connectors: but, however, nevertheless, on the contrary, on the other hand are used with less emphasis. They are also called "Adverse Connectors." 2 People smile an' tell me I'm the lucky one. And we've just begun. I think I'm gonna have a son. Above "lucky one" (n) means 'a person who has had recent good fortune, success etc.' (often used in a competition or a contest.) "Lily was the lucky one who got the position." 3 He will be like she and me, as free as a dove, conceived in love. The sun is gonna shine above. "She and me" is not proper English grammar at all! What is correct? "The expression "free as a dove" comes from "free as a bird" meaning 'having no duties or responsibilities.' 4 Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey. Everything will bring a chain of love. In the above sentence "Even though" (conj) is an adverse (i.e. opposing) connector of the main thought meaning 'in spite of the fact that'. "He is very ill, even though he walks daily." The word "ain't got" is poor English grammar and should be "haven't got" or "don't have". 5 An' in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me everything is gonna be all right. "Even though, although and though" have the same meaning most of the time; the longer the wording the more emphatic it is. "(cried) tears of joy" [tears of happiness,] 6 Pisces, Virgo rising, is a very good sign, strong and kind, and little boy is mine. "Pisces, Virgo" are the names of constellations and also two of the twelve signs of the zodiac. 7 Now I see a family where there once was none. Now it just begun. Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun. "Even though, although and though" could all be used in the following sentence, but "Even though" has the strongest tone and emphasis in English grammar. 8 Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey. Everything will bring a chain of love. "Even though, although and though" are often used at the beginning or middle of a sentence and less at the end. "I'm so in love with you honey, _____ we haven't got any money." 9 An' in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me everything is gonna be all right. "Even though, although and though" are in the same 'opposing' family as "but, however, nevertheless, on the contrary, on the other hand" are used with less emphasis. 10 Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup. Drink it up. Love 'er and she'll bring ya luck. The phrase "holds the world in a paper cup" means focusing on the pleasure of the moment, free from worry or too much of the world. "Jane holds the world in a paper cup." 11 If you find she helps your mind, better take 'er home. Yeah, don't you live alone. Try to earn what lovers own. Above, the phrase "helps (your) mind" means that something or someone assists one to be peaceful, at ease, and relaxed "I like to watch the sunset; it helps my mind." 12 Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey. Everything will bring a chain of love. Note the 'opposing' use of the connectors: "Martha's suit is blue, although it appears to be black." "Even though we have very different personalities, we get along alright." 13 An' in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me everything is gonna be all right. Note: The written forms 'tho' ' and "tho" are very informal and used by poets, singers etc. ENGLISH GRAMMAR EXERCISE - Choose the best connector or phrase. although - Even though - helps his mind - however - on the contrary - free as a bird - Pisces - tears of joy - lucky one 1 Casper likes to go fishing; he says it _______. 2 William isn't working right now, he's _______. 3 Mac's astrological sign is Virgo, but I'm ____. 4 Jil said Jay didn't enjoy Spain, _____ he loved it. 5 You're the _____; you have a month off. 6 Grandmother cried ____ when Jim was born. 7 Mickey always walks, ____ he has a car. 8 ____ I don't have money, I buy expensive tea. 9 I don't like shrimp; ____, I sometimes eat it.
