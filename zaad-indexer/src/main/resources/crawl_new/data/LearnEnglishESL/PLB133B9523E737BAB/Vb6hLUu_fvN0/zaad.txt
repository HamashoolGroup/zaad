ESL VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ESL LESSON - Figurative Language - Leson 11 1 Figurative Meanings - "literal" (adj) = 'taking words in the usual, basic meaning.' "figurative" = 'words with a different, not normal meaning, [e.g. metaphor] 2 When you're weary, feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all. Example: Literal "small" = 'less than normal size' Figurative "small" = 'unimportant' Figurative "Cara felt small in large crowds." 3 I'm on your side when times get rough and friends just can't be found. Literal means "rough"(adj) = 'uneven, not smooth surface.' Figurative means "rough" (adj) = 'difficult, unpleasant.' Figurative is "Jude had a rough day at the office." 4 Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down. Above, "bridge" is figurative because it means 'a person,' not the literal "bridge" used to cross rivers, but a simile. 5 Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down. "troubled water" (metaphor - a symbol) means 'problems, difficulties' Fig. "Living in large cities may bring a lot of troubled water." 6 When you're down and out, when you're on the street, when evening falls so hard, I will comfort you. Figurative "down and out" (adj) = 'a weak or poor position (e.g. depressed etc.) "It's hard to make new friends when you're down and out." 7 I'll take your part, when darkness comes and pain is all around. "darkness" (n) has many means such as 'evil,' 'ignorance,' and above, 'unhappiness. '"Patsy's darkness was lonely and full of pain." 8 Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down. 9 Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down! 10 Sail on Silvergirl. Sail on by. "Silvergirl" (n) and "sail" (v) give an image of value. (silver) girl "sailing by" her difficulties to a bright future. 11 Your time has come to shine; all your dreams are on their way. Figurative "shine" (v) = 'to excel, brilliant." "Beatrice shined when she gave the annual report to the board of directors." 12 See how they shine. The above sentence refers to the girl's dreams for the future. They "shine" implies they are brilliant and coming true. From the words, you get an image in your mind of two ships. One has Silvergirl sailing into her dreams and the other is her friend sailing nearby. 13 Oh, if you need a friend, I'm sailing right behind. 14 Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind! "ease ____ mind" means 'to bring peace and calm to one's thoughts ['easy']. "Her friend supported her and eased her mind." 15 Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind! Figurative language is the language of the mind and heart. It expresses 'the mind's eye' rather than the physical eye.
