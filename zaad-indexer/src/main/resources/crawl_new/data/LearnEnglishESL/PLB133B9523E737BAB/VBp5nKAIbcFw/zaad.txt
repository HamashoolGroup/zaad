The crocodiles ("crocs") are carnivorous reptiles that live in the tropics and subtropics of Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. 3 holding hands and skimming stones. Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own. In most species, the average adult length is between 6 and 10 ft (1.8-3 m). The largest, the Saltwater crocodile, may exceed 20 ft. (6 m). 4 But the biggest kick I ever got was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock. The extinct Sarcosuchus imperator, may have approached 40 ft. (12 m) in length! 5 While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock, we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock. Small crocodiles prey on fish and small aquatic animals; larger ones also ambush land mammals and birds near the water. 6 Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking when your feet just can't keep still. I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will. The Saltwater, the Mugger and the Nile crocodiles have been known to stalk or attack human beings for food. 7 Oh Lawdy mama, those Friday nights when Suzie wore her dresses tight and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight. Rules for crocodile safety are often posted on signs in parts of Australia. 8 But the years went by and the rock just died. Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy. A crocodile is sometimes called an "alligator", which it is not. However, some species may look similar to the less aggressive alligator. 9 Long nights crying by the record machine, dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans. The two forms are distinguished by a long lower 4th tooth. Only in crocodiles, does this tooth protrude when the mouth is closed. 10 But they'll never kill the thrills we've got burning up to the Crocodile Rock. Crocodiles move fast over short distances, even out of water. They have extremely powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth. 11 Learning fast as the weeks went past, we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last. It's said that a "croc" cannot open its mouth if it is held closed. Nevertheless, I, for one, do not plan on trying it to see if it's true!
