Always enjoyable programs! - Teacher Frank LESSON TRANSCRIPT 1 The two types of speech are 1) Literal 2) Figurative. "Literal" is usual, basic, often seen and often physical. In contrast, "figurative" is not usual and may be a metaphor; also it is often unseen and often mental. For example, a "road" can be a physical road (i.e. literal) or a life experience (i.e. figurative.) A "road" is road or something else. Note the words marked with an asterisk (i.e. *) in the following lesson. 2 The *road is long with many a winding *turn. That leads us to who-knows-where, *who-knows-when. 3 But I'm strong, strong enough to *carry him. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. 4 So on I go. His welfare is of my concern. No *burden is he to bear; we'll get there. 5 For I know he would not *encumber me. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. 6 If I'm laden at all, I'm *laden with sadness that everybody's heart isn't filled with the gladness of love for one another. 7 It's a long, long road from which there is no *return. 8 While we're on the way to *there, why not share? 9 And the load doesn't *weigh me down at all. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. 10 He's my brother, oh yeah. He ain't *heavy; he's my brother. He's my brother, oh yeah. EXERCISE What may be a meaning of the marked 'figures of speech?' Which one is a simile? 1 Peter is a *rock. I admire that in a man. 2 The assistant manager *flew down the hall. 3 Oh! All this work is *drowning me. 4 Business Law is a very *heavy subject. 5 With all this rain, I feel like a *duck. 6 She's in the *spring of her life, isn't she? 7 I'm glad that I have found my *rose.
