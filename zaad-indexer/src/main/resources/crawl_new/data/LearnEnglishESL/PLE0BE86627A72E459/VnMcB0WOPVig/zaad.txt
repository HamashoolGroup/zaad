STUDY ENGLISH WITH MOVIES - ESL LISTENING SCRIPT "If you've just TUNED IN, we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle." "You called the radio station?" "Christmas Eve, he phones in one of those radio call-in shows, and tells them that his dad needs a new wife." "And the SHRINK there practically forces the guy on to the phone and says "Tell me, what was so special about your wife?" " "Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, I think it was like..." "MAGIC." "...magic." "Sleepless in Seattle?" "That's what she called him on the show because he can't sleep." "And now two thousand women want his number." "Dear Sleepless in Seattle..." "The guy could be a CRACKHEAD." "Actually, he sounded nice." "You know, it's easier to be killed by a terrorist then it is to get married over the age of forty." "That's not true. That STATISTIC is not true." "That's right, it's not true. But it feels true." "Sandy has a girlfriend Glenda, she's a WEIGHTLIFTER. It's not like her neck is bigger than her head." "No, no, no. no, no. I'm not asking you to set me up." "What about Walter?" "Walter and I are engaged!" "When's the last time you were OUT THERE?" "Ah, Jimmy Carter, 1978." "Things are a little different now." "I'm having all of these FANTASIES about some man I have never even met who lives in Seattle." "It rains nine months of the year in Seattle." "I know!" "TIRAMISU." "What is tiramisu?" "You'll see." "Some woman is going to want me to do it to her, and I'm not going to know what it is." "You'll love it." "What if I never meet him?!" "What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?!" "Your destiny could be your DOOM." "I want to meet you." "Dad! Read this! Read this!" "Where is Seattle? Right. Where is Baltimore? Aaaah! It's right there! Look! One, two, three four, there's like twenty-six states..." "But, what I really don't want to do is end up always WONDERING what might have happened if only I could have done something. Is this crazy?" "That's what I'm trying to tell you, what women are looking for - PECS and a cute BUTT." "This is the one I like!" "There is no way that we are going on a plane to meet a woman who could be a crazy, sick LUNATIC. Didn't you see 'Fatal Attraction?" "You can't.., you can't even turn on the news nowadays without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute." "So, how's my butt?" "Not bad." "Really?" "Yeah." "Is it cute though?" "You grading on a curve?" End of Video Transcript
