Nothin' to get hung up about. 3 I'm free and it's so easy to get by 'cause I don't try. 4 In my paper cup, I have installed a shower stall across the hall. Running water and a den, it's looking just like home again. 5 I'm free and I've installed refrigerated air. You'd have to look inside before you'd know that I was there. 6 And everybody says I'm quite insane. And someday I'll be going down the drain. I know they're right (but I don't care). I feel no pain. 7 Here inside my paper cup, everything is looking up. No one goes out, no one comes in. it's looking just like home again. 8 I'm free and it's so easy to get the things I've always wanted 'cause I don't really want 'em anymore. 9 And living ain't so bad without a rudder. And life is kinda groovy in the gutter if you know how, (and I do). Yeah, and I do. 10 So, if you'd like to come along, we'll sing a little paper song about a lonely paper plate ho couldn't find a paper mate. 11 I'm free, yes, I'm free. And my life is looking up from inside my paper cup. 12 And I'm always looking up from inside my paper cup, etc. END OF LESSON ??? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?? ?? hablar Ingl?s comversation ??? ?? ?? n?i ti?ng Anh cu?c tr? chuy?n ?? ?? ?? parler Anglais conversation ????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? falar Ingl?s conversa m?wi?
