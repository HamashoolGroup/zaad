Talk to Miss Lan - Listen to our students
Published on Mar 3, 2015
This is Quang Khiem, Miss Lan's favourite student. He had been studying English with Miss Lan for about 10 months and his English has become surprisingly inspiring. He has such a great attitude in learning English. There has been another evidence that proves English is easy as long as you have a great attitude and are willing to learn.
