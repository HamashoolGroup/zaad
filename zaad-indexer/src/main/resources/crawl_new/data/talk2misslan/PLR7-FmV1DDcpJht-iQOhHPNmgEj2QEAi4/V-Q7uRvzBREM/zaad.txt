Everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel like home You're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment? Before I go? 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie You sound like a song My God This reminds me, Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time It was just like a movie It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears Cause nobody told me that you'd be here And I swore you moved overseas That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young When we were young It was just like a movie It was just like a song
