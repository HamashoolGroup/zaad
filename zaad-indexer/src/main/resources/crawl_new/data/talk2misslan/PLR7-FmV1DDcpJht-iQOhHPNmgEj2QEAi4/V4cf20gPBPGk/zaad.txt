Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen/Jeff Buckley (Lan Huynh feat. Nico Bez Y?h cover)
Published on Oct 12, 2014
Hi, I recorded this random duet back in 2013 during my trip in Hoi An. The setting was at a lovely guest house called "La Tonnelle", and I was singing Hallelujah for a group of nice French friends including Nico, a very sweet French gentleman. Hope you enjoy the song :x Find more about me at: http://facebook.com/talk2misslan http://tinycornercafe.com
