The RED Tour 2014
Published on Mar 30, 2015
This is one of the most phenomenal experiences that I have ever had in my life. I got to see Taylor Swift in Singapore for her Red Tour which is the last show performed in Singapore. I am hoping for having a chance to see her in her new album 1989. *** Keep calm and love Taylor Swift***
