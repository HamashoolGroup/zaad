Sydney - Australia Fall 2015
Published on Aug 1, 2015
I was teaching and living in Australia for a few months. It was in the winter. I was very homesick and missed my students so much. I walked to the same coffee shop everyday to edit this video. I was hoping that I could share with you guys a little bit about my lonely time there. lol... Well, I'm glad that you are watching this video.
