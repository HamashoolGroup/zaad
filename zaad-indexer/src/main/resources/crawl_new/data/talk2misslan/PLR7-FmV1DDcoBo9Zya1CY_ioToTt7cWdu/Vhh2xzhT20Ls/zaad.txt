General English Learning Tips - How to teach yourself English
Published on Mar 13, 2015
This is not a full show as we hadn't planned to film it. Though it was successful and everybody was happy. We hope to create a strong English speaking community in Can Tho. We are planning to have a show every 2 months at Tiny Corner. We are looking for speakers who are either Vietnamese or foreigners who are willing to share and encourage the young Vietnamese students. *** Follow us at: www.facebook.com/tinycornercafe www.facebook.com/talk2misslan www.talk2misslan.com *** For business contact: Please email us at talk2misslan@gmail.com
