American English Pronunciation Webinar 2013: Correct Word Stress and how to pronounce American English and reduce your accent in English. In this webinar we talked about how to speak English with an American Accent using correct word stress. Learning how to use the correct rhythm of English can be even more important than learning the exact sounds of English. When you use the correct rhythm of English, people will understand you the best. Word stress in English refers to stressing or emphasizing the correct syllable in a word. Every word in English has one syllable (or part of a word) that is stressed or emphasized more than others. Native English speakers use this constantly in their pronunciation and probably don't even realize it. It's a key piece to both understanding others in English and being understood yourself in English. In our full 12-week program you will learn in more detail about word stress as well as all of the other skills needed to speak with the correct rhythm of American English. Packages start at $99 for our full 12-week English Pronunciation and Fluency Training Course. Go to http://get.pronunciationpro.com/free7... to sign up! Hope to see you there!
