American English Intonation (3of4)
Published on Sep 7, 2012
http://get.pronunciationpro.com/free7... Hey there, This video is the 3rd of 4 videos I'll be posting on American English Intonation. These short video clips are taken from my 35 minute video lesson on Intonation which is a part of the 12 week online Pronunciation Pro training program. Go to https://pronunciationpro.com/signup to sign up for 1 free week of the program. This week as I've been preparing these videos I've been thinking a lot about intonation. It's amazing how many daily interactions I have that rely so heavily on intonation. I've been experimenting a little by using less than ideal pronunciation of sounds while using standard intonation. For example, I play basketball in the mornings a few days a week. As I was leaving this morning I said, "Have a good day". My pronunciation was sloppy, I hardly moved my mouth and the only word that was probably understandable was "day". However, my listener knew exactly what I was saying because of my intonation. The same goes for other common phrases such as, "How are you doing"? - /howeryadooin/ "Ya comin?" - /yuhkumin/ "nice to meet you" - /nicetuhmeechew/ "What are you doing?" /whuderyuhdooin/ There's SO much to talk about when it comes to intonation which is why I am hosting a FREE webinar on American English Intonation!
