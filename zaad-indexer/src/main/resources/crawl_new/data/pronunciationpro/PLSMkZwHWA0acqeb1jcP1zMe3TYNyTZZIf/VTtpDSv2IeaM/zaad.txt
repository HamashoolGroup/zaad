This English pronunciation how to video will teach you the different American English pronunciations of the word "the" and help reduce your accent in English when pronouncing words with the /th/ sound in them. Here?s how to pronounce the word ?the? in American English pronunciation: There are 2 different ways to pronounce the word ?the? in American English. These 2 words are: /thuh/ and /thee/. We can remember how to pronounce these by remembering bananas and apples. In my video I explain what I mean by that. The pronunciation of the word ?the? when the vowel is pronounced like /uh/ is used when a consonant follows the word ?the? in a sentence, like: the banana. The pronunciation of the word ?the? when the vowel is pronounced like /ee/ is used when a vowel follows the word ?the? in a sentence, like: the apple. However, saying the word ?the? with the /thee/ pronunciation is less commonly used. The other way we pronounce ?the? as /thee/ is if we want to emphasize something. For example: ?I met the President yesterday?. ?You met THE President?? In this case, the word ?the? in the second sentence is pronounced /thee/ because you?re emphasizing it.
