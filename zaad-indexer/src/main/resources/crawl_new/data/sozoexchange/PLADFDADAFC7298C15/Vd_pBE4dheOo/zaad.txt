http://www.sozoexchange.com How you say it matters! Hi, I am your host Natalie. Today's expression is "I love you." This is a phrase that you can use to express your love for someone. This is such an emotional expression that you want to use an appropriate tone of voice when saying the phrase, depending on the intent of your communication. I am going to demonstrate how to say that expression in three different ways: sincerely, sarcastically, and romantically. Please pay close attention to my facial expressions, tones of voice, and inflections.
