http://sozoexchange.com/quizzes/ Can you tell the difference?- Correct & Collect Today, we are going to learn about the difference in American pronunciation between the words "correct" and "collect". Many Asian speakers have difficulty pronouncing these words. The first word "correct" is a verb which means to remove error. The second word "collect" is a verb which means to gather together. Both words start with the same "k?" sound, but the difference between the two words lies in their second parts, "r?kt" and "l?kt." I will demonstrate how to pronounce these words. Please pay attention to the positions of my tongue and lips as I say these words.
