http://sozoexchange.com/quizzes/ Can you tell the difference? Today, we are going to talk about the differences in American pronunciation between the words "order" and "odor." The first word "order" is a verb which means to forcefully tell someone to do something. The second word "odor" is a noun which means an unpleasant smell. The word "order" has this "??" sound, followed by a tiny "r" sound like "??r" while "odor contains this "o?" sound. Let me demonstrate the pronunciation of these words.
