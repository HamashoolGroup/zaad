http://www.englishanyone.com/power-le... Learn to express yourself confidently in fluent English and sound like a native speaker with our FREE Power Learning video course! To get fluent faster, embrace slang! (Slang means any informal words and expressions that you wouldn't find in a standard English dictionary.) You've probably noticed that most native English speakers don't sound like the voices on your textbook CDs. Like your own language, the regular English of native speakers is usually short, casual and pretty fast. We don't talk like robots and you shouldn't either, so use the same slang we do and express yourself more smoothly in real English! Here are some examples you've probably heard before. Learn them, practice them and use them in conversations with native speakers! Going to = gonna Native speakers aren't going to buy some milk, they're gonna buy some milk. Want to = wanna Native speakers don't want to see their favorite band, they wanna see them! Should have = shoulda I should have kissed her? No, I shoulda kissed her! There are many more, so keep your ears out for 'em! Here are two things to remember about slang: 1. Don't write these words on your papers at school. We don't wanna hear about it from your teachers. 2. Remember that languages are alive! English is always changing, and people create new words every day. Don't worry about what the dictionary says when learning new phrases from people in conversations. Just have fun and keep practicing! Enjoy slang and start sounding native!
