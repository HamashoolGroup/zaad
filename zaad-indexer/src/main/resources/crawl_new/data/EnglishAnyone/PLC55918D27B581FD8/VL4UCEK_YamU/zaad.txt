http://www.englishanyone.com/power-le... Learn to express yourself confidently in fluent English and sound like a native speaker with our FREE Power Learning video course! To get fluent faster, set a daily goal! Language learning takes time! You can learn to ride a bike in a few hours, but many, many hours are required to learn another language. If you look at the whole process of learning English at one time, it can be overwhelming. There is so much to learn and it is impossible to learn everything you need to know without continued effort and practice. But, that doesn't mean that learning a new language isn't simple. Because you cannot possibly learn English in one day, stop worrying about all of the things you don't yet know. To get fluent in English, you must move slowly and set and achieve many incredibly simple goals. We want to produce thousands of videos to help students learn, but we can't possibly do make them all in one day. So, we set small, achievable goals, like making one video, that bring us a little bit closer to our ultimate goal. Begin by setting one goal that is so easy that you can't possibly fail to accomplish it. Try to remember one new word or phrase every day. Or try to meet one new English speaker every day. After a week or two, you'll be amazed by your progress. You'll also have more confidence to set bigger goals and get fluent faster. Start Now! Take the next step to fluency and begin accomplishing your goals today!
