To get fluent faster, become a spy! Listening practice CDs are fine for basic grammar, but the best way to know what REAL English is being spoken now is to listen to real English conversations. To do this, you need to become a spy and eavesdrop on real English conversations! To eavesdrop means to listen to a conversation that you are not a part of. Remember that, like any other language, English is alive! So, you have to listen to CURRENT, real English that speakers are speaking NOW in order to get fluent faster! All you have to do is go to a bar, coffee shop, sports event or any other place where native English speakers would gather and listen in on conversations. But, if you're feeling confident, make a comment by excusing yourself into the conversation. Entering other conversations is rude in some cultures, but English speakers are usually pretty friendly if you excuse yourself and open with a questions. As an example, if you hear two people talking about a movie you just saw, you can say, "Excuse me, but I just saw that movie and I really liked it!" What did you think about the ending?" If the people talking seem friendly and you can put something interesting into the conversation, then please do so. You just might make some new friends and improve your English along the way! Whether you're a shy beginner or a strong speaker, this is a great exercise to help you get out and hear REAL English. So get up from your chair and go out and find a great place to sit and listen to real conversations!
