To get fluent faster, change your environment! Native English speakers get to learn a lot of new words easily because they visit many different places in their daily life. English students, unfortunately, usually study in one place and only learn about different locations in textbooks. If you want to get fluent faster, study in different places! The whole English speaking world is your classroom, so please use it! Don't learn about the bank in a textbook; go to a bank! Don't learn sports words from a listening CD; go to a real game! Even if you just want to sit down, watch people and listen to real English, try studying someplace new. If you usually go to a caf? to study, try learning in a park! Listen to English and watch what people do in different places and your vocabulary will grow quickly. You'll also learn lots of useful phrases and be able to remember them more easily! If you don't live in a country with a lot of English speakers and events in English, just watch things on YouTube or other video sharing sites online. Watch sporting events, cultural events, TV shows, game shows, and anything else that shows people speaking English naturally and in everyday situations. If you are watching videos online, you can also improve your English by posting comments! As you watch videos, post ideas, opinions and any questions you may have. The more effort you put in to getting fluent, the faster you will see your English ability grow! Now get up, find a new place to study and start getting fluent in English faster!
