Change the way you THINK to start becoming a great English learner! Hello and welcome back to lesson three in your free 7 Day Email Video Course from EnglishAnyone.com! I'm Drew Badger and today we're going to go over two very important things you need to understand about how to THINK to become a GREAT language learner. But first, I want to go back over Lessons one and two for a quick review. Remember in Lesson one, we said that you should create a vision board. Remember to really think about what you want and then it will be much easier to achieve! And in yesterday's lesson, we covered three things that you should STOP doing if you want to become a great speaker. These things are, number one, to stop worrying about grammar rules, number two, to stop worrying about the pronunciation of individual words and number three is to speak, speak, speak and THEN worry about your pronunciation. Let's continue with today's lesson. In order to become a great speaker or English, you need to follow your own path. Follow your own path. This means to do what works best for you and do your own thing. This is part of the culture of English and it's something that's very important for you as a learner of English. You're not just learning the language of English. You're also learning the culture. We are a culture of individuals as English learners and we don't worry about how our pronunciation might be different from the pronunciation of a different speaker. I have friends all over the world, and in other English speaking countries, and we all sound different. So, the first thing you need to remember is to find your own voice. There are so many speakers out there. English is a HUGE language! There are many speakers of English and they all sound unique. Even in my hometown of Chicago, I have friends that were all from Chicago but they all sound a little bit different.
