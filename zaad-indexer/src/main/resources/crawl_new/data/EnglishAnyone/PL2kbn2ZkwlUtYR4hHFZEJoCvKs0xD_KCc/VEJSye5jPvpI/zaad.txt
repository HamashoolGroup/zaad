Learn the SIMPLE way to meet LOTS of native speaking practice partners for FREE! Hello there! I'm Drew Badger, co-founder of EnglishAnyone.com, and this is lesson six in your free 7 Day Email Video Course from EnglishAnyone.com. So far, in this video course, we've taught you lots of techniques about how to learn. Once you understand HOW to learn, learning English becomes much, much easier. ALWAYS focus on the things at the bottom, and that way, all the things at the top, like words and phrases, become much easier to learn and remember. In today's video lesson, I'm going to go into some really cool ways that you can change the way you think so that you can start meeting more native speakers who are excited to practice English speaking with you. Let's get started! Today, change how you THINK by imaging that YOU ARE A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER! Your English may not be perfect, but you're a native English speaker just like a baby or a young child learning English is a native speaker. You just know a little bit of the language and you're getting better and better every day. But, if you stop thinking that you are an English student, and just imagine that you are an English SPEAKER already, even if you are not perfect, then you can really start speaking with more native speakers. The best way to start meeting more people, once you realize that you ARE a native speaker, is to stop looking for conversation partners. It's really difficult to find people to practice speaking English with if you don't pay them. So, don't tell people, especially native speakers, that you want to learn English. What you have to do is find something that you are interested in and do that IN English. In that case, you'll be able to start meeting more English speakers to practice with, AND you can actually start teaching THEM a little bit at the same time.
