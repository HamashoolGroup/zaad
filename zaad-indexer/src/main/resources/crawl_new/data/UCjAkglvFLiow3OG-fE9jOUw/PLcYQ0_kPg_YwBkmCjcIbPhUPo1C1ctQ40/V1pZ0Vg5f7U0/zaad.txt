inlingua Vancouver 2015
Published on Dec 7, 2015
What can we say about 2015? Well, what a great year it was. We had a lot of fun and many activities, we met a lot of people and shared some incredible stories. Classes at inlingua involve more than just teaching English. In addition to great instruction we try as much as possible to provide you the best life experience ever. Remember - "Life is not measured by the number of breaths We take, but by the moments that take our breath away. (Vicki Corona) Thank you all for joining us this year. It was a pleasure having you at inlingua Vancouver. And we hope to see you again in the future. Tag and share with your friends. Let them see a bit about what you have experienced at inlingua.
