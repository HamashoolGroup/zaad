--- VIDEO TITLE: Countable and uncountable nouns with teacher Tash. --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Countable and Uncountable nouns- If countable and uncountable nouns are hard for you, don?t worry! I know lots of English native speakers who get confused. This introduction video will look at some of the most common nouns that are difficult to remember, especially ones that might be different in your native tongue. Some things in English are uncountable because we can?t count it, like water, and some things are uncountable because it would be too difficult, like rice. When a noun is uncountable, we have to use different words to describe ?how much? there is. Connect with us!
