---PREVIOUS VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBHj7... --- VIDEO TITLE: The difference between Lend vs Borrow Part 2 - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Lend vs Borrow Part Two- Lend and Borrow in more detail, you might want to watch part one first. They can be used in simple and perfect tenses, and the only difference between them is the direction! Remember... Lend= give for a short time and Borrow= take for a short time. That?s it. They can?t be used with ?since? but you can use ?for? to give information about how long you expect the lending/ borrowing to take. ?I?ve lent him my car for two weeks?
