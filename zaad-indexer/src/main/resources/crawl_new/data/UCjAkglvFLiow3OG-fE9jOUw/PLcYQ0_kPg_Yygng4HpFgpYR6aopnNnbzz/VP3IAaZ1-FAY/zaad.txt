The article Tree - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Feb 19, 2015
The Article Tree The 3 articles in English are a, an and the. The learner has to decide noun-by-noun which one of the articles to use*. In fact, there are 4 choices to make, because sometimes no article is necessary. Native-speakers, of course, use the articles correctly without thinking. English learners, on the other hand, need to have some guidelines for making the right choice - particularly those learners whose own language does not have articles, such as Japanese or Korean. The most important first step in asking: Do we know which one? Second step in choosing the correct article is to categorize the noun as countable or uncountable: - A countable noun is a noun that can have a number in front of it: 1 teacher, 3 books, 76 trombones, 1,000,000 people. - An uncountable noun is a noun that cannot have a number put in front of it: 1 water, 2 lucks, 10 airs, 21 oils, 39 informations.
