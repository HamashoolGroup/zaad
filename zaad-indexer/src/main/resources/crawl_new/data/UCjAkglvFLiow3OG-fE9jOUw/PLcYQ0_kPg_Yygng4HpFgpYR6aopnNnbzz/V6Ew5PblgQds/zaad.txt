--- VIDEO TITLE: English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver: Have or Get something done with Teacher Tash --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Have / Get something Done If you 'have something done', you get somebody else to do something for you. ? I'm going to have my windows cleaned. ? She's having her house painted. ? I'm having a copy of the poster made In informal English, we can replace 'have' by 'get'. ? We're getting a new sound system installed. We can also use 'have/got something done' in situations where something bad has happened to people or their possessions. This is not something they wanted to happen. ? John had all his money stolen from his car. ? We had our window broken by a football. Connect with us!
