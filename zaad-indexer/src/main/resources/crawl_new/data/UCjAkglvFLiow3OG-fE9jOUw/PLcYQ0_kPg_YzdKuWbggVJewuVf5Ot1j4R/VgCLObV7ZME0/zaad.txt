--- VIDEO TITLE: I/and/(but/However,)/because/so/That's why______." - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Hi folks. This next video teaches a set pattern to practice: "I/and/(but/However,)/because/so/That's why______." You can see the "However" is in brackets, and that's because sometimes, you can skip it in your practice, and just go directly to because. However, the however is very useful.:-) Now, maybe you're thinking these conjunctions are easy, and you've seen them before. But that's not the issue. This issue is, you have to USE them frequently in real conversation and writing. You know, so many students fail to develop and extend their thoughts using addition, contrast, and cause-and-effect. In fact, this practice technique will build your real speaking and writing fluency, and your ability to "think in English". SO, watch the video a couple times, and then use the concepts in your real-life English communication. Cheers! -Troy --- TEACHER: Troy Connect with us!
