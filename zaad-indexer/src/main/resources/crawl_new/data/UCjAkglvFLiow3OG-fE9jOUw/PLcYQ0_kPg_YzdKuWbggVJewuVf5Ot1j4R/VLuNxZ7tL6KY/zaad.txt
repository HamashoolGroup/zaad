Another Popular, Common, and Super Useful Grammar Pattern
Published on Jun 2, 2015
. VIDEO TITLE: Another Popular, Common, and Super-Useful Grammar Pattern: "The more_________, the more______" (Also, the more, the less; the less, the more; the less, the less) Teacher: Troy VIDEO DESCRIPTION: This video will add more to your growing pile of awesome English speaking (and writing) tools. This grammar pattern, "The more____, the more______" is really useful, due to the fact that it reflects natural causal relationships in nature and the universe. Everywhere we can see relationships of cause-and-effect, in both a positive, and negative sense. These are called "feedback loops", or "the snowball effect." The pattern is similar to the zero, or first conditional grammar structures. As always, students need to start opening their eyes and ears, in order to see how truly ubiquitous this pattern is. In fact, it's arguably more common and useful than other, more commonly taught grammar structures, like the verb tense "Past Perfect", which although useful, can't really compare to a pattern like "the more, the more" in terms of application. Remember, "say it, write it, catch it." Many examples are given, and viewer examples are elicited, using topics like "weather, "interest rates", and "powerful cars". Finally, the video teaches how to "juggle" this pattern with the other key patterns, which allows the speaker to say some pretty interesting things. Check out this "combo": "When it comes to speaking English, the reality of the situation is that, the more key patterns you can juggle, the better." So, have fun getting even better, as you incorporate this pattern in to your English life. Connect with us!
