Sometimes, simply using a comparative adjective is not enough. In this situation, you need a qualifier. ?Tom is taller than Jenny? ?Tom is taller than Mike? is Mike taller than Jenny? We don?t know! But if we use a qualifier ?Tom is a bit taller than Jenny? ?Tom is a lot taller than Mike? we know that Mike is shorter than Jenny. This video will introduce the most common qualifiers and show you how to place them in a sentence. There are some practise questions at the end for you. Connect with us!
