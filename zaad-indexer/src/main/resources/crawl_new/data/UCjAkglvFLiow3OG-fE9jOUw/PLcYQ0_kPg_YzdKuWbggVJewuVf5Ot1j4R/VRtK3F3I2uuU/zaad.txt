--- VIDEO TITLE: 20 ways to say "But" in English - Contrast Patterns - English Lesson with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: This video is designed to further expand your ability to say "but", or to use "contrast" in many different and sophisticated ways. In this video, I've included 20 different patterns that are forms of contrast. If you come up with your own statements as I've recommended in the homework section, and practice your own speaking and writing examples, in addition to reading my examples a couple of times, your English skills will increase quickly and easily. Finally, as always, open your eyes and ears, and become more *aware* of these patterns in the real English that is all around you. Watch the news, read newspapers, listen to people, and enjoy making some big changes in your English skills. Thanks for watching, and good luck. See you next time. -Troy --- TEACHER: Troy Connect with us! Email: info@inlinguavancouver.com Twitter - https://twitter.com/inlinguaVan Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/inlinguaVanc...
