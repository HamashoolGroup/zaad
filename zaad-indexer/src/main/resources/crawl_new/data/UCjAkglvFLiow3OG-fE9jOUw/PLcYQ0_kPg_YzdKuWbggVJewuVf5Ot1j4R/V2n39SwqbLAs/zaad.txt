--- VIDEO TITLE: If not and Unless - What's the difference? - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Today, let's discuss the conditional "unless" and how it differentiates from "if not". Students are often told that unless they practice, they won't improve. But if you don't know what 'unless' means or how to use it, you might get the wrong idea. This grammar lesson focuses on the negative conditional and the consequences that follow. --- TEACHER: Jacob Connect with us!
