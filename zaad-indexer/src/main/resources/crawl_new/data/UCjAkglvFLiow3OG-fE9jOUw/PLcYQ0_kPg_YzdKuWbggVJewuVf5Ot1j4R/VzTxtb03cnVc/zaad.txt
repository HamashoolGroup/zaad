Used to - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Mar 26, 2015
--- VIDEO TITLE: Used to - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Used to- We use 'used to' for something that happened regularly in the past but no longer happens. ? I used to cycle to work but I stopped two years ago. ? Ben used to do karate every week. ? I used to smoke, but I?ve quit. We also use it for something that was true but not any more. ? There used to be a mall down the road from my house. ? She used to have pink hair! ? I didn't use to think he was cool, but now I do. 'Used to do' is different from 'to be used to doing' and 'to get used to doing' Connect with us!
