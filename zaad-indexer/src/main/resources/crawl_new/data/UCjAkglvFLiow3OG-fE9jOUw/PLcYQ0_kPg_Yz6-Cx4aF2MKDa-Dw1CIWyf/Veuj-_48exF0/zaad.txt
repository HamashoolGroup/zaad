The difference between Must vs Have to - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on Apr 2, 2015
The difference between Must vs Have to - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver with Teacher Jacob. Whereas "have to" expresses our obligations to others, "must" expresses what we feel subjectively is the necessary thing to do. This distinction becomes clear when one considers the negative forms. When l say "I do not have to do something", it means I do not have the obligation to others to do something and I get to choose what to do. However, when I say "I must not do something", it means i feel and belive to the best of my knowledge that it is imperative that I "not do something." Connect with us!
