Present Perfect vs Past simple - English Lessons with inlingua Vancouver
Published on May 21, 2015
--- VIDEO TITLE: Tash - Present Perfect vs Past simple --- VIDEO DESCRIPTION: Present Perfect vs Past simple - We use both of these tenses to talk about past experiences, but you need to know when to use which one. The present perfect is used initially, to mention general information ?I?ve been to Paris? or to talk about multiple experiences ?I?ve met him four times? and we use the present simple for adding detailed information ?I liked him? ?I went in June?. We also use the present perfect with superlative (The Best!) experiences. ?It?s the best trip I?ve ever taken? Connect with us!
