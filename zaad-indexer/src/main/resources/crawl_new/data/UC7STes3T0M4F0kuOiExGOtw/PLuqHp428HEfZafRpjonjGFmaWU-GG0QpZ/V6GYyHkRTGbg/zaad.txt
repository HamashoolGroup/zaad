Published on Sep 30, 2014
Musical English lesson for "Can" and "Can't." Learn English, have fun and rock! Lyrics: I can run and I walk. I can write and I can talk. I can read and I can sing. I can do so many things. But I can't turn back time and i can't fly like a fly I can sleep and I can dream. I can be what I want to be. But I can't turn back time and I can't fly like a fly. No, I can't stop time.
