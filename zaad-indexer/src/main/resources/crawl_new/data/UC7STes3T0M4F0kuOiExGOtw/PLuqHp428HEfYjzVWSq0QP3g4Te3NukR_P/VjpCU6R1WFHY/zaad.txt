"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes" - Rockin' English
Published on Oct 22, 2014
Modern recording of the nursery rhyme "Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes" complete with an animated video showing the dance. The time through the song is slow, then there are two upbeat repeats. Sing and dance along, learn English and rock! Lyrics: Head and shoulders, knees and toes (Knees and toes). Head and shoulders, knees and toes (Knees and toes). Eyes and ears, and a mouth and a nose. Head and shoulders, knees and toes (Knees and toes).
