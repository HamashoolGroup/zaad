Elementary English. Lesson 12. Future tenses. Will and going to
Published on Mar 4, 2013
How do we use future tenses in English? This video explains the difference between will and going to, and explains how to use future tense in English. Future tenses are much easier than past/present tenses in my opinion. The main thing to remember is: WILL/WON'T/GOING TO = predictions WILL/ WON'T (+ infinitive) = spontaneous decisions, offers, promises, suggestions (I'll help you carry your luggage) GOING TO (+ infinitive) = future plans (I'm going to go to Greece in summer) More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on gerunds and infinitives here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlx0u...
