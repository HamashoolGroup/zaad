Elementary English. Lesson 14. First and second conditional
Published on Mar 13, 2013
How do we use the word 'if'? This video explains the difference between first and second conditional, as well as how we form them in English. FIRST CONDITIONAL (likely situations) IF + PRESENT SIMPLE / WILL or WON'T + infinitive If you come to the party, you will enjoy yourself. If it rains, we won't have a picnic. SECOND CONDITIONAL (Unlikely situations) IF + PAST SIMPLE / WOULD or WOULDN'T + infinitive If I found some money, I would buy my wife some flowers. If I were president, I would decrease taxes.
