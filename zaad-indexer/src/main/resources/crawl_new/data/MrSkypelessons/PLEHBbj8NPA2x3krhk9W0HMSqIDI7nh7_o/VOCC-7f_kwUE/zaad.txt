Advanced Vocabulary Course: lesson 4
Published on Nov 9, 2015
This advanced vocabulary course is designed to work in tandem with episodes on the US version of Sherlock called 'Elementary', and exercises on my website. You can find more grammar and vocabulary questions here: https://www.skype-lessons.com/advance... I advise students to do the following: read the exercises, check any unknown vocabulary, watch the show, answer the questions, and then retell it using the target vocabulary and grammar. The retelling is necessary to activate new phrases in an easy to remember context. Please repeat the vocabulary using this video and the questions which accompany the video. Please subscribe for the whole course. Lessons will be released on a weekly basis. And please answer the following questions: Do you think there should be a limit on the number of people granted political asylum? Why (not)? What kind of things do you have a flair for?
