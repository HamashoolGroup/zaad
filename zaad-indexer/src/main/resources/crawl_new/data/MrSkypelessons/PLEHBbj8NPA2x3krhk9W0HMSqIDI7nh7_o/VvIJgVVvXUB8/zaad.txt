Advanced Vocabulary Course: lesson 6
Published on Dec 24, 2015
This advanced vocabulary course is designed to work in tandem with episodes on the US version of Sherlock called 'Elementary', and exercises on my website. You can find more grammar and vocabulary questions here: https://www.skype-lessons.com/advance... I advise students to do the following: read the exercises, check any unknown vocabulary, watch the show, answer the questions, and then retell it using the target vocabulary and grammar. The retelling is necessary to activate new phrases in an easy to remember context. Please repeat the vocabulary using this video and the questions which accompany the video. Please subscribe for the whole course. Lessons will be released on a weekly basis. And please answer the following questions: How does your company drum up business? Do you have any friends who tend to back out of plans at the last minute? Do you know anyone with an amputated limb? What happened? Have you ever testified? What happened? Do you have to run any errands today? What's the most compelling argument for raising/lowering taxes? INVERSION Had he died in the crash, there would have been more blood.

No sooner had he examined the sand than he concluded that it wasn't from that beach. Rarely do culprits confess to their crimes https://www.skype-lessons.com/
