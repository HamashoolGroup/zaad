RELATIVE CLAUSES
Published on Mar 13, 2014
Here is a quick lesson about defining and non defining relative clauses, and how we use them. The uses of 'that' or 'which' and commas are also discussed. Non defining relative clause = extra information = sentence has the same meaning without it = USE A COMMA = Mustn't use 'that'. Only 'which' or 'who' Defining relative clause = necessary information = sentence has different meaning due to this info = NO commas = the word 'that' can be used More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on gerunds and infinitives here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlx0u...
