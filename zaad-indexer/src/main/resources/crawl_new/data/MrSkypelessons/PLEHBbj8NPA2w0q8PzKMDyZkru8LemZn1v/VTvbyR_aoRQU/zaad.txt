Published on Nov 24, 2015
This is the second lesson of a course I am doing on articles. I hope I can make clear another meaning of the word 'the', which defines one class among other classes (species, inventions, modes of transport, groups of people). https://www.skype-lessons.com/articles/ THE = specified We know which one. Identifiable to the listener Used for 1 (specified) class, among other classes (The rich, the unemployed, etc..) Therefore, also used for species, inventions, modes of transport etc.... A/AN = unspecified, countable/singular NO ARTICLE = unspecified, plural/uncountable It doesn't matter which one Used for introducing or describing Used when we mention something for the first time Time expressions In a week (future) at the of the week (this week) during the day/night at night in the morning/afternoon/evening last/next year (2014, 2016) the last year (unfinished period. 365 days to the present) in the year 1999 Please try this quiz http://www.quiz.biz/quizz-853469.html Please find more lessons on my blog https://www.skype-lessons.com/online-...
