How do we form the passive in English? This video is aimed at intermediate level and above, and I attempt to remind the student why we use all the different tenses as well as give them the passive structure for each tense. Please try the following quiz http://www.quiz.biz/quizz-891625.html Do / is done Is doing / is being done have done / have been done did / was done was doing / was being done had done / had been done will / will be done will have done / will have been done can / can be done ____ing / being done to + infinitive / to be done More lessons and quizzes on my blog http://www.skype-lessons.com/blog More lessons on tenses here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEvy...
