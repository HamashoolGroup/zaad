Summary of tenses - Lesson 3
Published on Nov 27, 2012
This lesson is a summary of all 12 English tenses. I use diagrams and examples to give a brief summary of the logic of each tense and how it is used. This is a very quick summary of all tenses. Lesson 4 (which will come in a week) will look at the perfect tenses in more detail. Please ask questions if you have any - I will be delighted to answer them. https://www.skype-lessons.com/blog/en...
