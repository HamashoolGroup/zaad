INVERSION (subject - auxiliary)
Published on Jun 16, 2015
In this advanced English lesson we focus on sentences in which the subject and auxiliary verb are inverted. This occurs when we use questions, question tags and echo questions. But it is also used for 2nd and 3rd conditional, as well as with negative adverbs. 1) Questions, echo questions, question tags, so/neither Are you sure? Yes, so am I You don't know him, do you? I found it yesterday. Did you? So did I 2) Negative adverbs (At no time, not once, never...) Never have I seen such a wonderful view At no time did he offer any help Under no circumstances should he take any exercise 3) More negative adverbs (No sooner, seldom, rarely, barely, hardly, scarcely, only, little) Only later did I learn the truth Little do you know... 4) 2nd and 3rd conditional Had I known it was your birthday, I would have bought you a present Were I a rich man, I would buy myself a yacht 5) So / such So helpful was he that I tipped him generously Such a long distance was it, that we decided to take the train More lessons and quizzes on my blog https://www.skype-lessons.com/
