British English Accent Training Lesson 46: ?Beautiful?
Published on Mar 5, 2015
In this British English Accent Training Lesson, I practise the pronunciation of many synonyms of ?beautiful?. Please see the list below. ?Beautiful? is sometimes overused. It can describe physical and visual sights, such as a person, painting or view, but shouldn?t be used as a generic positive adjective. Radiant Alluring Beguiling Ravishing Stunning Gorgeous Dazzling Divine Stunning Breath-taking Angelic Hot Fit (British slang) These videos on my Youtube channel provide free educational material about British English, British pronunciation and British accent training.
