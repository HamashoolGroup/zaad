Over the moon / on cloud nine If you are "over the moon" or "on cloud nine", you're absolutely delighted and very happy about something: EXAMPLE "Manchester United supporters are over the moon / on cloud nine today." On / from a different planet Used interchangeably with "on" and "from" with two polemic meanings: Describe someone who seems a bit crazy or unrealistic: "You talk such nonsense sometimes, you're on a different planet, I swear." Describe someone or something which is so amazing they can't be from this world: "She's special, she's from a different planet." NOTE: be very careful to understand the context so you know if it is the positive or negative. Someone is a "star" They are wonderful / very special / talented at something: "Thanks so much, you're a star!" "Star" can be a very positive adjective too: "She's a star employee within that organisation." Reach / aim for the stars Seek lofty dreams / goals / objectives: "Reach for the stars -- you can do anything you set your mind to." Once in a blue moon Describe something that happens very rarely: "He's actually completed his homework! That happens about once in a blue moon." "Men are from Mars, women are from Venus." (The sexes are so different as to be from separate planets.) Further reading Scientists and religious clerics meeting together: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-env...
