Skype username: BritishEnglish_Teacher Busuu.com username: BritishEnglishTutor Auxiliary Verbs The three most common auxiliary verbs are: do, be, and have. Do Does Did Done Be Am Are Is Was Were Been Have Has Had Get used to making a soft "z" sound for the third person singular verb conjugations (ending in "s"). Love Loves Loved Like Likes Liked Read Reads Read (different pronunciation) Speak Speaks Spoke Spoken Write Writes Wrote Written Bring Brings Brought Buy Buys Bought Go Goes Went Gone Get Gets Got Modal Verbs All the auxiliary verbs except be, do and have are called modals. Unlike other auxiliary verbs modals only exist in their helping form; they cannot act alone as the main verb in a sentence. Be, do, and have also differ from the other auxiliaries in that they can also serve as ordinary verbs in a given sentence. We use them to show obligation, possibility and necessity. The modal verbs are: Can Could May Might Will Would Shall Should Sound more polite - examples "Can / could you open the window, please?" "Would you like to go out with me?" "Would you like to give me your email address?" "May I have a glass of water, please?" "Do you want to do it, or shall I?" "Do you want to do it, or should I?"
