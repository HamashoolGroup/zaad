Quotes - http://www.shakespearequotes.co.uk/co... A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool. Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. Better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Expectation is the root of all heartache. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. ("Thy" = "your".) Listen to many, speak to a few. Modest doubt is called the beacon of the wise. My pride fell with my fortunes. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. No legacy is so rich as honesty. Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough. To do a great right do a little wrong. Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Ten Usable Quotes http://languageandthecity.tumblr.com/... Sonnet 18 Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou growest: So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
