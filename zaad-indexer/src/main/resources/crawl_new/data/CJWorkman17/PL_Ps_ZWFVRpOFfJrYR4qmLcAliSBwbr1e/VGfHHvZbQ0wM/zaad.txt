Skype username: BritishEnglish_Teacher Busuu.com username: BritishEnglishTutor A Poison Tree by William Blake I was angry with my friend: I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I watered it in fears, Night and morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night, Till it bore an apple bright. And my foe beheld it shine. And he knew that it was mine, And into my garden stole When the night had veiled the pole; In the morning glad I see My foe outstretched beneath the tree. A VALEDICTION FORBIDDING MOURNING. by John Donne AS virtuous men pass mildly away, And whisper to their souls to go, Whilst some of their sad friends do say, "Now his breath goes," and some say, "No." So let us melt, and make no noise, 5 No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move ; 'Twere profanation of our joys ('Twere = It were) To tell the laity our love. Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears ; (th' = the) Men reckon what it did, and meant ; 10 But trepidation of the spheres, Though greater far, is innocent. Dull sublunary lovers' love ?Whose soul is sense?cannot admit Of absence, 'cause it doth remove (doth = does) 15 The thing which elemented it. But we by a love so much refined, That ourselves know not what it is, Inter-assur?d of the mind, Care less, eyes, lips and hands to miss. 20 Our two souls therefore, which are one, Though I must go, endure not yet A breach, but an expansion, Like gold to aery thinness beat. (aery = airy) If they be two, they are two so 25 As stiff twin compasses are two ; Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show (Thy = your; fix'd = fixed) To move, but doth, if th' other do. And though it in the centre sit, Yet, when the other far doth roam, 30 It leans, and hearkens after it, And grows erect, as that comes home. Such wilt thou be to me, who must, (wilt = will) Like th' other foot, obliquely run ; Thy firmness makes my circle just, 35 And makes me end where I begun.
