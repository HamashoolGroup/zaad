Learn British English Free: Grammar Phone-in 1
Published on Sep 15, 2015
This is part 1 of the BBC Radio 5 Live ?Up All Night? Grammar phone-in from 24 August 2015. Presenter Dotun Adebayo and British grammar experts Neville Gwynne and Terry Victor discuss a number of grammatical issues. In this part, they debate whether ?rules? of English grammar must always be followed, or can they be broken? They also talk about the phrase ?Queen?s English?; ?innit?; ?would have? or ?would of?; ?ain?t?. Copyright to the BBC. I do not own this audio.
