Learn British English Free: Hypercorrectness
Published on Oct 1, 2015
Hypercorrectness Where people try so hard to be correct, they can get stuff wrong! Please see below (click ?Show more"): ?You and I? or ?you and me?? ?You and I? is technically correct in many cases such as: ?We?re good together, you and I.? But what about prepositions? ?Between you and I? or ?Between you and me?? (Please listen to Grammar Phone-in #2) Now, ?Between you and me? is correct because ?between? is a preposition and we need to use the prepositional pronoun (?me?) as a result. However, some may focus on ?you and I? because they want to be correct as in the first example and therefore get it wrong!
