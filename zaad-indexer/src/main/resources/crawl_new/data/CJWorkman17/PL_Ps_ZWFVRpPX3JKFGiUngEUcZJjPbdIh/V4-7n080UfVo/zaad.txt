(Including fish.) Rob is a vegetarian. There are vegetarian products in UK supermarkets and animal rights groups who campaign. People may choose to be vegetarians because they don't like the taste of meat, are against mistreatment of animals, believe animals deserve to be treated like humans, or for health reasons. Studying at university Can start at 0900 and finish at 1800, but unusual to have lessons all day. Lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions are different. Socialising at university: clubs and societies Examples of clubs: caving; hiking; kung fu; kite-surfing; athletics; French; maths; chemistry Joining clubs relevant to you is one of the best ways to meet new friends at university.
