BBC news article on London 2012 volunteers: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19201329 Question from Cilene I'd like to know how to pronounce them when they're followed by a word which starts with vowels. I was reading Shakespeare and there was a pun with it, and another video about accents. Seems like in American English, the song I'm referring is like a "z". But in British English, it really sounds like "s", but I'm not sure. I mean "this apple" (thiSSapple or diZapple)? Answer In Britain we use the "s" sound, almost linking the words. This apple. thiSS-apple This house. thiSS-house This object. thiSS-object Note: "h" acts like a vowel at the beginning of words. Question from Cilene The words "ride" and write" are pronounced the same way, the ONLY difference is that the "i" in the first word is longer... What? Don't you pronounce the "t"s and "d"s in the middle of a world? Or was it a particularity of a specific accent? Answer Listen to me pronounce the words. There is a difference.
