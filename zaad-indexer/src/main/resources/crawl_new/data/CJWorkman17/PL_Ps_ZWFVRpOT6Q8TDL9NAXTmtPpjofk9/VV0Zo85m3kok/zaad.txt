British English Song #2 (words and music by Chris Workman) This British English Song Is neither right nor wrong, Hopefully not long, It's already begun! We'll learn something, I'll play and sing, We'll forget everything, Then we'll be done. No-one's English is near perfect. Some native speakers don't have a clue. So as long as you keep learning You're doing the best that you can do. Is it "trousers" or "pants"? A "faucet" or "tap"? A "bin" or "trashcan" In the UK? If you're in the US You mustn't forget (Compared to what I said) English ain't quite the same. Do you "do" or "make"? Give or take? For your own sake Just try your best. Work each day, Hear what I say, Hope or pray And you'll get the rest. Don't forget that language should be fluid, Moving freely like birds in the sky. Never doubt that you can do it. The question should be, "How?", not, "Why?" And prepositions Ain't easy decisions If no-one listens To your mistakes. Verbs and nouns Go round and round With the same sound, What will it take? So reach out far, Find where we are, You'll be a star, I believe in you. Please have no fear 'Cause we are here Not far, but near, And we are true. If we seem unkind, Like something's on our mind, You mustn't be shy, Just come our way. Say "Hi!" or "Hello" And you never know We probably won't go, We'll smile and say, "Hey!"
