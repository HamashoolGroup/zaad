Learn British English Free: Cheers By Chris from http://www.learnbritishenglish.co.uk/ Please click "show more" for info: Hello, everyone. I?m Chris from England. This lesson is for Mojtaba Yaghoubi and the Ava Language Training Centre: Markaz? Amoozesh? Zabaan? Engelisi? AVA This lesson is about the word ?cheers? which has three meanings in informal English in Britain. We can use it to toast (celebrate) something, said when we have drinks and touch them together: ?Cheers!? It can be a substitute for ?thanks?: ?Cheers for doing that for me.? And, it is also a substitute for ?bye?: ?Cheers for now, see you later.? Three uses of one word, when in casual and informal settings. I hope that was helpful.
