Published on Sep 14, 2014
For more info: http://gonaturalenglish.com/ What?s the difference between ?May? and ?Might?? These words are very similar but this video will help you know when to use them and when to use a different word completely. ?May? is used when you?re asking for permission. For example: ?May I go to the restroom?? Have you ever asked, ?Can I go to the bathroom?? and then had someone correct you and say, ?May I go to the restroom?? When do you use Might? ?Might? is used when you are discussing the possibility of doing something. Maybe something that you wouldn?t usually do. For example: ?Do you want to go skydiving?? ?I might.? Can you see the difference? Do you use ?May? or ?Might? when asking for something to drink? ?May I have something to drink?? Do you use ?May? or ?Might? when responding to a question about your future plans? ?Are you going to the movies with me tomorrow?? ?I might.? It?s that simple! Want to learn more?
