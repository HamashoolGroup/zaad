Learning and writing lyrics is a great way to build your English vocabulary. A lot of creativity goes into writing songs so when you can understand what?s being said in the song, you can learn new metaphors or slang. Lyrics are a more accurate depiction of everyday English and translating them can give you a glimpse into a new musical culture. But remember, translating lyrics to or from your native language can be a challenge. Some phrases won?t have an equivalent in your language or they might mean something else. So take your time and be patient with yourself. What else can you do? Keep reading; listen to audio books and radio broadcasts. Anything that will help you start to think in English.
