How to Overcome Obstacles and Improve Your English
Published on Dec 23, 2014
http://gonaturalenglish.com/italki Let's talk about mindset in English language learning. Is English a problem that is keeping you from the things you want in life? I've heard this before. "If I was fluent in English, my life would be so much better." Does that sound like you? Let's consider your mindset. I've recently read a book that helped me to reconsider the way I see problems, or obstacles: The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph This book tell us that we can obstacles as problems or as opportunities. We all have many obstacles in life. Will you let them stop you or will you use them as opportunities to grow? If English is an obstacle, could we see it as an opportunity instead? You can learn English with Go Natural English online and that is a great opportunity to use English as a tool to connect with people and grow in life. If you don't have native speakers to practice with, that could be seen as an obstacle to learning natural English. How could we make this into an opportunity? Again, we can use the internet to work with native speakers to learn English. If you haven't tried online lessons with a native English speaking teacher at iTalki, now is a great chance to start with a voucher for 2 lessons for the price of one plus a free eBook guide.

Let's grow together though English! http://gonaturalenglish.com/italki
