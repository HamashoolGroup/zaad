http://gonaturalenglish.com How do self-introductions help you connect with the people around you? In this episode, you?ll hear an example of a self-introduction and how you can make your self-introductions better with four specific strategies. Just as the name implies, your ?self-introduction? is when you introduce yourself to a someone and talk about the value, or information you offer. Introducing yourself to strangers can sometimes be tricky because what you say depends entirely on the context or situation. In essence, your self-introduction has to begin somewhere (at least with a greeting such as ?hi? or ?my name is?) . What is important is to introduce yourself in a way that is appropriate and makes people like and remember you. Keep these tips in mind next time you are introducing yourself to someone: In any introduction, you must let the person or people know your name, however, try not to keep it so basic. ?Hi, my name is _____? works, but it is not the best way to keep your audience engaged. If you really want people to remember you, try associating it with something unique (For example, my name ?Gabby? literally means to ?talk a lot?). Try talking about something you are interested in or a passion you may have (your hobby, work, or some unique/talent skill are also appropriate). Do not forget to ask questions! As you introduce yourself, see it as an opportunity to get to know the people your?re talking to. Lastly, it is always wise to judge your environment before introducing yourself. You would introduce yourself differently depending on whether you were addressing an audience before you give a speech, meeting new coworkers, or just starting a conversation with a new person at a party, or event.
