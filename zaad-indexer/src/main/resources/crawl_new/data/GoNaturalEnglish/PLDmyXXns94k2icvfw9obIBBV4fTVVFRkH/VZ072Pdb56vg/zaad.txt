Published on Jul 30, 2014
Practice with a worksheet for this lesson: http://www.gonaturalenglish.com/ Have you ever been confused about the difference between a person?s job and their profession? Gabby explains it all in this short video. ?Job? is the name of the work that you physically do. Your job is your occupation. It?s what you do to earn a paycheck. Let?s say you work at a daycare center. It?s your job to care for the children and to make sure they go home with their parents in perfect health. But, your profession is a Child Care Service Provider. Even when you no longer work at that center, you will still carry that profession. The job might have ended, but your profession will always stick with you unless you completely change careers. Remember that a person?s profession encompasses everything they do. It?s what they are educated and qualified to do. Take a minute and try to figure out your profession and your job. Thanks for watching! Want to learn more?
