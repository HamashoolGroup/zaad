For English learners, it may be difficult to hear the intonation in a native speaker?s voice. (Intonation is the vocal emphasis that we place on certain words in a sentence) For example: ?Do you speak English?? Your pitch should be higher when you say ?English?. This is how the listener knows that you?re asking a question. But, what if the question doesn?t have any change in intonation? ?Where are you from?? The speaker?s voice is very flat with this sentence so you have to look for the ?Question Word?. Question words are words like: How Where When Who If you don?t hear the intonation, you can listen for the question words and answer accordingly. Want to learn more?
