There are so many factors that can cause you to confuse one word with another. If you're having trouble, don't worry about it! Even native speakers struggle from time to time. In this video, Gabby gives an excellent explanation of some very confusing English vocabulary. For example: Can and Can't sound very similar. Especially when followed by a verb. 'I can do it,' and 'I can't do it' are almost identical when spoken. TIP: Pay attention to the vowel sounds. The differences are subtle, but they can definitely be heard. Vowel sounds can make or break your comprehension of a sentence. Practice listening to native speakers and soon it won't be so hard anymore. TIP: You should also focus on the speaker's tone and attitude. Do they seem happy or are their expressions more on the negative side? The clues are everywhere; you just have to find them! English is a tricky language to conquer but practice makes perfect. AVAILABLE NOW: 17 Secrets to Listening Skills in English.
