Published on Feb 20, 2015
http://gonaturalenglish.com/italki http://gonaturalenglish.com In this English tip episode, I talk about 3 keys for English fluency. The keys are: Plan -- Imagine the situations when you will want to use English. Think about your goals, whom you want to speak with, about what, when, where and how. Practice -- Think to yourself in English, speak out loud to yourself or others, use what you learn immediately and often! Pills -- Unfortunately there is no magic English fluency pill. However, learn English in small amounts to stay motivated. Study a little each day and you will see your fluency improving quickly over time.
