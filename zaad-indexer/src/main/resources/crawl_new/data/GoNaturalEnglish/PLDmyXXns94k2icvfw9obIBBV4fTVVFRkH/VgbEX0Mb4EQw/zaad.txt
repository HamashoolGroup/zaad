How To Greet People Like A Native English Speaker?
Published on Sep 15, 2014
Visit http://gonaturalenglish.com for more information. As an English learner, your greetings might sound stiff or rehearsed. This quick video will help you greet people in a much more natural way. First impressions are so important and greetings have to be memorable and sometimes casual. Some questions you can ask: -How?s it going? -How are you? -What?s new? -What?s up? (This is a very casual greeting and it should only be used with friends.) When you respond, never say, ?I?m fine?. People hardly say this. Try saying: -I?m good, and you? -I?m great! -I?m fantastic, thanks for asking. These are all good responses. Remember, when you pick your greeting and response pick the one that best suits you and your personality. Are you more serious or more casual? Are you around a lot of business people or do you spend most of your time with friends and family? If you know the people around you, it will be easy to choose which words are better for different groups of people. Want to learn more?
