Unfortunately, this word combines three of the most difficult sounds in the English language. They?re difficult because they?re unique to English. The sounds might be different in other languages. Let?s go through this step by step. ?W? To make this sound, form a circle with your lips. ?Wor? The ?Or? now sounds like ?Ur? from ?Fur?. Once you make all of these sounds together it will almost sound like you?re going to say ?Word?. ?Worl? If you have trouble with ?R? and ?L? sounds, remember that your tongue does not touch the roof of your mouth. This doesn?t happen until the end of the word. ?World? Say it slowly at first to get a feel for it and soon, it won?t be so difficult anymore! Want to learn more?
