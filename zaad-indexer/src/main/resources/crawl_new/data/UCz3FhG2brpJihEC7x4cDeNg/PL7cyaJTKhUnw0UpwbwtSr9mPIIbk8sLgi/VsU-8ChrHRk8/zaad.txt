TOEFL Reading Skills III: Signal Words and Inference Questions
Published on Sep 27, 2012
In the 3rd video we continue to explore the TOEFL question types by examining the INFERENCE QUESTIONS. We also discuss SIGNAL WORDS and learn about the different roles they play. Finally, we present a model of reading called ACTIVE READING where we learn how to become more involved in the process of comprehending text by PARAPHRASING and REORDERING information.
