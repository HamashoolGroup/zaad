COMPASS Writing Preparation--Part 5: Rhetorical Skills
Published on Mar 14, 2012
In this part of the video series, we begin our transition from the USAGE/MECHANICS questions to the other category of the COMPASS Writing Test-RHETORICAL SKILLS. We begin by revisiting the concept of REDUNDANCY, focusing on it as a concept of writing STYLE. The information from this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... In addition, two resources were discussed in the video for further writing practice: The Purdue OWL: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/sec... and the textbook The Essentials of English by Ann Hogue: http://www.pearsonlongman.com/ae/esse....
