COMPASS Writing Preparation--Part 4: Sentence Structure
Published on Mar 2, 2012
In the fourth video of the series, we explore the SENTENCE STRUCTURE questions by examining the ideas of the basic order of ideas in English, while also discussing issues of PARALLELISM, REDUNDANCY, and PRONOUN AGREEMENT. We also address a couple of common COMPASS Writing test tricks. The information from this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf.... In addition, two websites were discussed in the video for further punctuation and grammar practice: The Purdue OWL: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/sec... and the Capital Community College Quiz Page: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/gramma....
