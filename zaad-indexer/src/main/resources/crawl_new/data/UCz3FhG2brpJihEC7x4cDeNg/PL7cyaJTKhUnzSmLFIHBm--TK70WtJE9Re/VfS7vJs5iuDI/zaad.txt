Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 4-The 10 Basic Vowel Sounds
Published on Jun 9, 2013
In the 4th video, we begin our discussion of VOWEL SOUNDS in English, starting with the 10 BASIC VOWEL SOUNDS. These are sounds based around the vowel letters of the English Alphabet: A, E, I, O and U. Each of these vowels have at least two different pronunciations, two of which are discussed here: LONG (or ALPHABET) sounds, and SHORT (or RELATIVE) sounds. We demonstrate the differences between these two sets of sounds using a technique called "rubber band hands." We also discuss some basic spelling rules of these vowel sounds, and finally we provide a brief overview of the evolution of English spelling and vowel pronunciations by examining the historical changes of the language itself.
