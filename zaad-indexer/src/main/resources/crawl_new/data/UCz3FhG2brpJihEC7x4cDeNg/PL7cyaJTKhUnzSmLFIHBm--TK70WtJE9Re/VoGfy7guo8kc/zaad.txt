Intro to Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 3-Consonant Digraphs and Trigraphs
Published on Jun 5, 2013
In the 3rd video of this series, we explore the concept of CONSONANT DIGRAPHS and TRIGRAPHS, which are graphemes that use two or three letters to produce one sound or IPA symbol. (By the end of this video, you will have studied 24 phonemes, leaving 22 phonemes remaining to learn in English.) We also continue our discussion of the origins of English and look at how different languages influenced some of the spelling patterns we see in English.
