Compass Reading Preparation-Part VI. Making Inferences
Uploaded on Nov 9, 2011
In the sixth video of this series, we begin to examine the other reading question type-the Reasoning Questions, specifically addressing how to make an inference on the test. A distinction is made between making an inference in general-where there could be more than one interpretation or idea in real-life-and how to make an inference on a multiple choice, objective test such as the Compass. Some tricks and strategies are also discussed. The sample questions in this video can be found at: http://www.act.org/compass/sample/pdf....
