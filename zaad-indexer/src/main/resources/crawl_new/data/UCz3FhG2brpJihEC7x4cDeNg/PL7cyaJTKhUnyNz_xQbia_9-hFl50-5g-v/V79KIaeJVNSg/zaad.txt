TOEIC Writing Skills II: Respond to a Written Request
Published on Mar 26, 2013
In the 2nd video of the series, we explore the requirements of Questions 6-7, RESPOND TO A WRITTEN REQUEST. We discuss the importance of following EMAIL ETIQUETTE, including understanding the ORGANIZATION and necessity for POLITENESS LANGUAGE in the request itself. (NOTE: There is a mistake in the sample response on the screen. I have included the corrected text below.) SAMPLE RESPONSE: Hello! Thanks so much for the email. I really appreciate the hospitality. I would like to ask a couple of questions about Dale City: Do I need to pay city taxes directly or will they be taken out of my escrow? When is the first payment due? Will I be able to turn on my utilities before I move in? Will you be able to help us or should I contact the utility companies directly? Thanks again for your time. I'm really excited about moving to Dale City. Take care, Jon Reynolds The TOEIC Speaking and Writing Handbook: http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/TOEIC/...
