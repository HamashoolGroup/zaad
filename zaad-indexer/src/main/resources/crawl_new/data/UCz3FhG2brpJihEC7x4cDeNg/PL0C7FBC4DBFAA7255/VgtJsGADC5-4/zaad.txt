Uploaded on Jun 7, 2011
This is the 2nd series of videos for the Summer 2011 Intensive English Program TOEIC/TOEFL Writing skills course. In Part One, we discuss the importance of planning before we write by using a tool called Concept Mapping. This tool allows students to think more deeply about the essay topic by connecting to personal experiences and engaging in a process of asking questions to develop arguments for the essay.
