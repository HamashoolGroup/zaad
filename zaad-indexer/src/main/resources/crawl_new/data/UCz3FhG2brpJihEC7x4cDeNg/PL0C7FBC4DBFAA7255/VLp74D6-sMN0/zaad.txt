Day Three Part 2 TOEIC TOEFL.m4v
Uploaded on Jun 22, 2011
This is the 2nd part to the 3rd series. In this video, we review the importance of topic sentences, and then begin to discuss how to develop a paragraph and a suggested paragraph organizational style for the TOEIC/TOEFL Independent Writing Tasks. NOTE: I apologize for the buzzing sound on the 2nd half of this video. Unfortunately, I don't have time to correct and re-record, but I hope to do so in the future.
