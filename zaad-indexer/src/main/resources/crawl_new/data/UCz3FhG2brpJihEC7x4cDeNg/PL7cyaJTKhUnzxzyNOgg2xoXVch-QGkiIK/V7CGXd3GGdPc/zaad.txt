Published on Oct 23, 2012
In the first video of the series, we provide a brief overview of the TOEIC Listening section, along with a more detailed look at Part I: PHOTOGRAPHS. We discuss the common tricks used on this part, including looking at SIMILAR SOUNDING WORDS, what you can PROVE versus what is POSSIBLE, and DISTRACTING ANSWER CHOICES. NOTE: It is recommended that you watch the TOEIC Reading Skills Video 1 BEFORE watching this video if you wish to learn more about general test strategy for the TOEIC and more information about the test itself.
