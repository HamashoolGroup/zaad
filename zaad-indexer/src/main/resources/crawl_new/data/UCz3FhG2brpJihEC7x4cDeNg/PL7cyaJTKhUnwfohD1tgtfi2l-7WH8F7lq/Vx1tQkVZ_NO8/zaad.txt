Published on Mar 12, 2013
In the 2nd video of the series, we explore how to write an INTRODUCTION to the INDEPENDENT WRITING TASK, including how to make it more interesting by adding a HOOK and how to provide a clear direction by including a THESIS. We also do a couple more brainstorming activities to help think more deeply about our writing topic. ETS approved sample responses: http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/TOEFL/...
