Advanced Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 4-Intonation
Published on Jul 21, 2013
In this video, we explore another SUPRASEGMENTAL idea-INTONATION. We learn about the concept of PITCH and how INTONATIONAL PATTERNS will determine how the voice will rise and fall to indicate the intention of the speaker's sentence or question. We also learn about the FOCUS WORD, which is usually the last CONTENT WORD of a sentence or question. (NOTE: At around 13:00, the FOCUS WORD could be either TIME or TODAY. Most people would probably emphasize the word TIME.) Speaking & Pronunciation website: https://sites.google.com/a/kentonesl....
