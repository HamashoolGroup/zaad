Advanced Speaking & Pronunciation: Video 7-Thought Groups and Changes in Focus
Published on Jul 31, 2013
In the final video of this series, we review the idea of FOCUS WORDS and discuss how speakers can change the FOCUS depending on their intention. We also explore the concept of THOUGHT GROUPS, which are chunks of words often grouped by patterns of STRESS, INTONATION, FOCUS and LINKING. THOUGHT GROUPS can include COLLOCATIONS, NUMBERS and PUNCTUATION. (NOTE: Some sources teach RHYTHMIC UNITS as an example of a THOUGHT GROUP. In this video series, we do not. For more about RHYTHMIC UNITS, please go back and watch video 3-Basic Sentence Stress).
