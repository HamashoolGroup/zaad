English Listening Level 1 - Listening English Lesson 15 - Halloween Night. Halloween is fun. My mom buys candy. My Mom buys potato chips. My Mom buys chocolate bars. It is for the trick or treaters. My Mom buys me a costume. It is a ghost costume. I am going to be scary. My sister is going to dress up as a princess. She will have a wand. She will have a crown. She will look beautiful. My Dad buys a pumpkin. It is going to be a Jack O'Lantern. We draw a face on the pumpkin. We carve the face with a knife. Our Jack O'Lantern looks funny. We go trick or treating. We knock on the neighbour's door. We say, "trick or treat." Our neighbours give us candy. We say thanks. We go to many houses. We go home. Our parents check our candy. It's safe. We eat lots of candy. We don't feel very good. We go to bed. ? Thanks for watching! ? Please share and like if you enjoyed the video :) thanks so much ? ??????????????????? ?
