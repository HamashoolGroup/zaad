English Listening Level 1 - Listening English Lesson 17 - Thanksgiving. We are having Thanksgiving at our house. My whole family is coming. My parents bought a turkey. It weighs 30 pounds. It takes a long time to cook. My Mom wakes up early to cook the turkey. I clean the house with my Dad. The house smells good. We help Mom in the kitchen. I peel potatoes and carrots. My Dad makes pumpkin pies. My Mom cooks squash. I help my Mom make stuffing. I mix the bread and spices. We make good stuffing. It goes inside the turkey. We put on nice clothes. I set the table. My Dad carves the turkey. My Mom makes the gravy. Our relatives arrive. We say "thank you" for all we have. We eat and eat. It is a good Thanksgiving. ? Thanks for watching! ?
