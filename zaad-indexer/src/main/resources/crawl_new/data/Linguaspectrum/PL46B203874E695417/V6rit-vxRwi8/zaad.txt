Uhum! Captain Britlish? I say! Terribly sorry! Didn?t see you there. I was just limbering up. Like to stay in shape, you know. The briefing, Captain. Ah, yes! The briefing. Bear with me, would you? I?ll be with you in a jiffy. Okay. I?ll be brief. That?s probably why they call it a briefing! Ha! Ha! Ha! Today?s mission is to get you up to speed on the vocabulary of stairs. Stairs are those little floors that help us get between the bigger floors in a building. If you live or work in a building with more than one floor, you certainly use stairs on a regular basis. I know I do. This video has been made in four parts. Part 1 is to practice your listening skills and there are no subtitles on screen. Part 2 has subtitles on screen. You can listen and read at the same time. Part 3 has phonetic subtitles to help you learn the 44 symbols and sounds of the British IPA chart. Part 4 has alphabetic and phonetic subtitles to better help with your mastery of the IPA symbols. That?s it. Off you go now. Tally ho! http://linguaspectrum.com/britlishfre...
