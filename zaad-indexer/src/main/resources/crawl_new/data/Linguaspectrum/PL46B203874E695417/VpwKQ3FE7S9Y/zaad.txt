Schr?dinger's Cat
Published on Oct 29, 2015
In 1952, the American experimental composer John Cage composed his Four Thirty-Three "silent" musical piece which is notable for not having any sounds in it. He wasn't the first, either. In 1897, Alphonse Allais composed his Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man, which consisted of twenty-four blank measures. Hearing of these, or rather not hearing them, prompted me to realise just how Avant-guard I would be if I made a video along similar lines. Cage chose four and a half minutes as this was the standard length of "canned" music in his day. I have chosen 21 seconds for my video, as this is the average length of viral cat videos on YouTube. My video, I hardly need point out, also features a cat, so should go viral with your help. I give you, Schr?dinger's Cat. The coolest viral cat video on YouTube. Also the funniest must-see viral video ever.
