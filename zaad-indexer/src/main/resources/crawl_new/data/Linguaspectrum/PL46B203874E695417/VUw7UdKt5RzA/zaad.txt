Happy New Year in 133 Languages
Published on Jan 1, 2010
British English at http://Britlish.com More lessons at http://linguaspectrum.com Happy New Year to all my students all around the world. I thought I would take this opportunity to wish each of you a very Happy New Year in your own language. I was able to do this in 133 languages. If your language is not here, I'm sorry, but I still wish you a very Happy New Year and hope that all your dreams and plans come to fruition in the New Year. If I have made any mistakes with the translations, I beg your pardon, but hope that you will appreciate my attempt and that you won't be too annoyed with me. A very Happy New Year to all my students, and to all those who have watched my videos and supported my efforts over the past few months. I sincerely hope that you have found something of value or at least entertaining here and that you will continue to watch my videos over the coming months. Your friend and teacher, Richard.
