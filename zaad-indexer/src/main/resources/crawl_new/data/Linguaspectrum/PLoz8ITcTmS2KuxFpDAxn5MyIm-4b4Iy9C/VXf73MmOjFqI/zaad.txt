? British English Expressions Bank: http://linguaspectrum.com/British-Eng... ? The British English Expression - Brolly Brolly is a very British, informal name for an umbrella. The British say that it will never rain if you take your brolly with you, but will always rain if you don't. Everyone I know has forgotten at least one brolly on a train or a bus.
