Daffodils - A Little Bit of Britlish
Published on Nov 11, 2015
http://britlish.com/book/daffodils/ I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud by William Wordsworth I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. This lyric poem by William Wordsworth was voted the fifth most popular poem in England. Poems, with their regular rhythm, provide a great opportunity to examine the stress-timed nature of English. I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o?er vales and hills Exaggerated like this, you can easily hear the rhythm of English. oOoOoOoO I?ve used this poem as the topic in the first of my series of Little Bits of Britlish, an eMagazine now available at http://britlish.com/book/daffodils/ The lavishly illustrated PDF file contains embedded audio files. These embedded audio files allow you to listen to me reading not only the poem but also the entire text of the PDF file. The poem is available in both Latin alphabet and the IPA phonetic script, to help you learn the phonetic script and improve your pronunciation. The Little Bit of Britlish also has a biography of Wordsworth the poet, and tells the story behind the writing of this poem. I also look at rhymes used in the poem, as well as the stress pattern. There are activities, too, to help you practice what you learn. While the PDF is lavishly illustrated with full page images, I also include a text-only version that you can easily print out. I hope you?ll join me at http://Britlish.com for a Little Bit of Britlish. Goodbye for now.
