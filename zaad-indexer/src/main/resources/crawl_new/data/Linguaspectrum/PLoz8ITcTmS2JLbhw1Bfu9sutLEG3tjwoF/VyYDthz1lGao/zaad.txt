A Britlish Christmas Message (not an English lesson!)
Published on Dec 14, 2014
A very silly but fun message to wish everyone a Happy Christmas from everyone at Britlish.com and to thank all those who watch my videos. If you really want to know what all this Christmas nonsense is all about and want a real Christmas English lesson, please watch my Christmas Story videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qni3... and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Nks... I can promise you that great things are coming to Britlish in 2015! (When I say everyone at Britlish, I mean me). In order to make the best possible Video English Lessons, I need to master the software. This little video was created as I tried to get to grips with paths and cameras in iClone 5.51 Pro. Having a target makes the learning more relevant. iClone 6 is due out any day now, and I have already made my pre-order for the software. It's more exciting than Christmas itself.
