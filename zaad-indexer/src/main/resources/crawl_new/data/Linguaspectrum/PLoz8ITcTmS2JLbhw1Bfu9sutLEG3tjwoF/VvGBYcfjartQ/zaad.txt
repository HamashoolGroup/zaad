It is particularly useful for students whose first language is not English. Candidate 1 has not prepared and it shows. Um, um, um? Yes, I'm glad you've asked me that. Well, I'm, um, originally from Wakefield where I used to live before I moved. It's a nice town, it's a bit boring, if you know what I mean. I'm single and straight, that is, not gay, whatever anyone else might say. I like animals and I used to have a dog, but he died. Reversing the car in the drive? didn't see him. I'm looking for a job with, um, opportunities for, um, development. I'm good with people, or most of them, when they get to know me of course, but I'm not keen on kids. Candidate 2 has prepared and it shows. I've been working in customer services for six years now. My most recent experience has been in the IT industry, mainly supporting home users. As I enjoy reaching out to people, I particularly enjoy the challenge of remotely assisting people who in many cases have very little idea about computers. I suppose my patience is one of my main strengths. I pride myself on being able to remain calm and polite no matter how challenging the customer may be, and some are challenging in the extreme. I always try to use a methodical approach to solving problems, and this normally results in a satisfactory outcome. I'm now looking for a position in a company that places emphasis on high-quality customer care. I'd like to be part of a team in which I can play a role in increasing overall customer satisfaction and retention. Who do you think got the job? Who would you employ?
