Vain Vampire - Halloween English Lesson
Published on Sep 29, 2015
Vain Vampire is an English lesson specially for Halloween. Teachers should find it useful for higher level students. Students should find it useful as a way of learning some new vocabulary and expressions in English. I created it as part of my journey into the world of 3D animation using iClone 6 and the Character Creator software from Reallusion. ?
