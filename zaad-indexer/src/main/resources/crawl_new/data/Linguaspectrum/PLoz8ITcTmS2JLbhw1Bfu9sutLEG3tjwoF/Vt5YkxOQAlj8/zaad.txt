Candidate 1 I have been writing professionally for over ten years and pride myself on my attention to detail. I have a degree in journalism and have worked both as a copywriter and a copy editor. I can adapt my writing style to the needs of any publication or writing task. I enjoy working to deadlines, and feel that grammatical accuracy and the right choice of vocabulary are the key ingredients to writing good copy. Candidate 2 I think that most people who know me like me a lot. I'm really good with people, and I'll help anyone at any time. You might say that I definitely have people skills. My mum always said I had eyes like a hawk, and I certainly do see things that other people overlook. I got a degree in journalism at university, and I am often asked to write letters and press releases for colleagues. Oh, and I'm a very good chess player, if you ever fancy a game? Who do you think got the job?
