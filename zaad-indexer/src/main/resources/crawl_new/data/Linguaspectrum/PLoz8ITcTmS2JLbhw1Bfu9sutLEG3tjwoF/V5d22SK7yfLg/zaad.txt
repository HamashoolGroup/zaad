Typescript for 62 video English Lessons including this one: http://britlish.com/product/linguaspe... This 3D Animated video English Lesson is based around the English idiom, to kick the bucket. In it, I examine the reality of our impending and inevitable death in an innovative, entertaining and engaging way. There has never been a YouTube English lesson quite like this, and it is the start of many more imaginative lessons to come. I think it safe to say that this is the most innovative English lesson you will ever have seen - unless you have already seen the next one, of course! If you are serious about improving your English, then perfecting your accent should be an important part of the process.
