An African Adventure - Learn English Faster with Laughter
Published on Dec 23, 2015
Vote on the funniness of this joke: http://linguaspectrum.com/an-african-... Another very funny joke in the Learn English Faster with Laughter series. I hope you enjoy it. If you were faced by a hungry lion while on safari in Africa, what would you do first, run or put your trainers on? This is an old joke, but a very funny one, nevertheless. Its humour comes from the sudden realisation that what we immediately assume to be the truth is sometimes not. I made this animation in iClone 6 with props from SketchUp 3D Warehouse. Many thanks to my wonderful wife, Roc?o, for lending her voice to the video. In British English, trainers refer to running shoes, which are known as sneakers in American English.
