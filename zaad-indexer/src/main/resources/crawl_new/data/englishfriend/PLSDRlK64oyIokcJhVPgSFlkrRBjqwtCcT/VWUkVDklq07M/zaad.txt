why I am a good teacher...
Published on Feb 19, 2016
What makes me a good teacher? Here's my thoughts... Get emails from Jade: http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Note to teachers: Obviously there are still good teachers in the mainstream education system. I had some inspirational teachers myself at school and also at university. However, what I noticed about these teachers was that being good teachers did not help them progress in their careers. The schools want their teachers to tick all the boxes and to follow rules; the best teachers ignored that kind of stuff and taught from the heart. My point being here is that good teachers are under a lot of pressure and stress to conform to the rules and to take the originality and spontaneity out of teaching.

I believe the best kind of teaching is when teachers are free to use their creativity without being bogged down by rules and regulations. Sadly, modern education and the school factory system seems to have gone awry. ---------- RELATED VIDEOS YOU MAY LIKE: Why I Won't Help Educational Victims: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmQ9a...
