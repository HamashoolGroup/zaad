When the ghosts come...
Published on Oct 30, 2015
A poem about ghostly encounters. (Words to the poem below and in captions) When The Ghosts Come There are those among us Who go a-hunting for them. With torches in hand And breaths held tight At the stoke of midnight in paranormal search they wend Infra-red gizmos calibrated To detect the unbodied Those who were Our once dear And now, sadly departed kin Stuck somewhere between Here and there Wandering and lost. There are those among us Who go a-talking with them In sodden graveyards By the light of the moon. In secret ritual they invoke With magical chants Mind-altering potion Or rapt, solemn Meditative intent: Calling forth the souls Of the dead but not gone To commune with them. There are those among us Who go a-dreaming with them When the night is black And the living deeply sleep Dreamers with ghostly sight In supernatural encounter meet That which exists in the unseen Between here and there. What do the seers see at night? A message, a ghoulish sight A spinning orb of angelic light? Only the dreamer can say In the drowsy moment Before the spectre fades away.
