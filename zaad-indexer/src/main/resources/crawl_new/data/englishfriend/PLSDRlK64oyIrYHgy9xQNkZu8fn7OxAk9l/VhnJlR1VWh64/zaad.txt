The British are known across the world for speaking with a clear and precise accent (otherwise known as Received Pronunciation or R.P.). To be able to speak with a clear British English accent it is first necessary to develop and strengthen the facial muscles at the side of the mouth. Once you have trained up these muscles by doing the speech training exercise I demonstrate in the video, you too will be able to speak with a refined and clear British accent. Ultimately, when your voice training is complete, you may even sound like the British Royal Family! To join my email list: http://jadejoddle.com/join/
