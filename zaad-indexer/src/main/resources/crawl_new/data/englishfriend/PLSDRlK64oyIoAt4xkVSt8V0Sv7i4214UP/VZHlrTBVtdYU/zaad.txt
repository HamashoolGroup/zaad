Posh and Cockney Jane Austen (Most Random Video Ever)
Published on Sep 6, 2013
http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Thanks to everyone who made a suggestion for my 5000 subscriber video special - I was in the mood to make a really random video - that is why you see me quoting Jane Austen in a posh and cockney accent. It seemed like a good idea at the time :-/ The version of Sense and Sensibility I like is by Ang Lee - I cry every time I see it. Anyway I hope you like this video and thanks again to you all for subscribing L:-)) -- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below?
