Why four years from now you will sound like the Queen... PLUS get your free Received Pronunciation audiobook: http://www.audibletrial.com/jadejoddle The way we speak is constantly evolving. As time passes, it is normal to observe a person's speaking pattern change in terms of accent and vocabulary. In this video I talk about how British politics influences the way people speak English in their daily lives. This video was filmed soon after the relection of the Conservative Party in 2015. My prediction is that this will lead to a comeback of the R.P. accent (Received Pronunciation). In earlier videos I have made regarding Received Pronunciation (2012-13) I said that the accent is dying a slow death. I take this back now. The accent was merely dormant for a time! If you are interested to know more about R.P., I highly recommend 'Access Accents: Received Pronunciation' on audible.
