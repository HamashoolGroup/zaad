How an INTJ Thinks (MR HEAD)
Published on Jan 28, 2016
How does an INTJ Think? Let's jump inside my brain to find out. WATCH PART TWO: https://youtu.be/RIhoJD5YXVs The INTJ personality looks at the world by analysing it and breaking it down into patterns. When an INTJ encounters a problem, he or she will apply intuition and reasoning to find a solution. Sometimes this results in breakthrough moments and radical solutions. However, the endless thinking and analysing can also get the INTJ absolutely nowhere. The thinking self of an INTJ person is dominant to the point that it may completely ignore the body and the emotions. This can cause problems such as neurotic obsessions and numbing the emotions. This video is about my personal experience of having a breathing problem as an INTJ. This video is Part One of Two on the subject of the INTJ mind.

A duty of his Is to keep me safe, Keeping a lookout... For Bogeymen! Together we reason: If x equals z Then therefore thus C must be half Of one twenty-three, And nothing bad will Ever, ever Happen to me. What he does best Is to manage the ship. He spies on the boys To make very sure that they?re Not slacking off. But something goes wrong. ?NO, NO! THAT WON?T DO! The lungs?ve sunk down By thirty percent! It?s time now for your Performance review. Till that?s been done, I?ll be the one Who?s breathing for you!? In-sucking air Mechanical bellows: Tight, sharp, and dry. The airway?s alarm Rings loud and shrill Till the so-called Master, Old Mr. Head, can sort Everything out. ?Look at that mug! He ain?t got a clue. We?ve been breathing At thirty percent ?Coz ?e told us to!? But Head never listens To lackeys like these. He?s the Big Cheese (So he likes to think) And he?s the one to call All the shots. No matter what The body knows The body knows itself: Each breath breathed In and out Birth till death ---- Copyright Jade Joddle 2016 Poem edits by Nina Lalumia If you enjoyed the poetry and story of this video, I have some other videos you may like too: 1.
