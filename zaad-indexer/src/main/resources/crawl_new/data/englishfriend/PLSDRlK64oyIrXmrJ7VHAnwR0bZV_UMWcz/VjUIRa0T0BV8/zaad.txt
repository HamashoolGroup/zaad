How to do a glottal stop - Estuary & Cockney Pronunciation
Published on Oct 27, 2013
http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-... Talking about the glottal stop - a feature of the Estuary English and Cockney English accents. I show you how to do a glottal stop and give you some sentences to practise. Speakers with Estuary English (my accent) or Cockney English accents (many working class Londoners) often replace the /t/ sound in words with a glottal stop - which isn't really a sound. If you want to sound like a native speaker from London, you have to learn how to make a glottal stop. -- Learn a British Accent FAST: http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-...
