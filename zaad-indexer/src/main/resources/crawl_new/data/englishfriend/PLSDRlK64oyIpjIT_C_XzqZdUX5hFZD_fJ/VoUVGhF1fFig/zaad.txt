http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-... You can't speak like a native, until you master the rhythm of English. In this video I reveal the secret of English rhythm so that you can improve your accent. The trick to getting the rhythm of English right is all to do with the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables when we talk. We speak in a pattern of iambs - an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. Speech that reflects this natural rhythm feels like music to our ears. When speech does not reflect this rhythm, it is difficult to understand and sounds unpleasant to native speakers. Also find out about iambic pentameter - the special rhythm that is used in famous British poetry and by the dramatist Shakespeare. ---- How to Get a British Accent Fast: http://jadejoddle.com/british-accent-... --- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below?
