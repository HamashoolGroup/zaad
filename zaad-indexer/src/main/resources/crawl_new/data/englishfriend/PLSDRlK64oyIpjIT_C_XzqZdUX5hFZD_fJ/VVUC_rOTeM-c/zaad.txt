It's not always easy for Asian speakers of English to show emotion in their voices. It may be difficult to have the same tonal range that native speakers of English have, due to the English language having a different use of tone to Asian languages such as Mandarin. In English tone is used to convey feelings. A single word can have many different interpretations, depending on the tone. Not understanding nor applying tone can make the English speech of Asians appear to be without emotion and if monotone, hard to understand.
