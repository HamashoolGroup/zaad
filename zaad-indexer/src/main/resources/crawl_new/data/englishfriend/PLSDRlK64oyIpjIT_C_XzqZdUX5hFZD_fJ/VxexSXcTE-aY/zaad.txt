Find out how to say these words in the right way! Learn English with Jade Joddle: http://jadejoddle.com/learn-english-g... 'Cunt' is one of the worst swear words you can say in English so you need to be sure that you can say the word 'can't' correctly. However, the difference in the pronunciation of the two sounds is not hard to learn so don't worry about saying the wrong word. In British English the word 'can't' has a long /a:/ vowel. The phonemic spelling of the word is /ka:nt/. When we make this sound the jaw drops down and the tongue position is towards the bottom of the mouth, though it does not touch the teeth. The American English pronunciation of this word is different. They say /k?nt/. This pronunciation doesn't not have a long vowel sound. It's the same vowel as in the words 'cat' and 'hat' in British English pronunciation. The swear word 'cunt' has a different vowel. The vowel in this word is /?/. This is the same sound as in the word 'love' and 'cup' in the British English pronunciation. The main this to note about this sound is that it is a short sound. There is sometimes confusion about the way native English speakers with a London / cockney / Esturary English accent say the word 'can't'. In these accents speakers often drop their /t/ sounds. This means that you do not hear the /t/ in this word and instead hear something like 'carn' or in phonemic spelling /ka:n/. This confuses people because they don't know if the positive verb 'can' or negative verb 'can't' is being said. However it need not be confusing. That's because 'can' takes a different vowel. It's the same as the American English pronunciation because it has the vowel /?/. ---- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below?
