Come as you are ('My Shit Self')

http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Shy, awkward, loner, hermit or social freak? There is NO ADVICE in this video to tell you how to deal with your communication pain or social anxiety. Join My Course: http://jadejoddle.com/introvert-course/ I put a lot of pressure on myself in social situations. There is this part of me that is always striving and working away to bring her very best self along to the gathering. I realised that is a dumb thing to do because it is very tiring to sparkle each and every time you are being social and anyway its only one step away from being fake. Most of the time I don't have the strength to sparkle. That's when my good friend social avoidance comes along. I just hang out with myself until my low energy vibes clear. *PROBLEM* I am really bored of social avoidance and withdrawal now (best buddies since my earliest years). Either I figure out to be perfect all the time so that I can socialise more (errm... too hard), or, I let more people see 'My Shit Self'. What you are watching in this video is only a video representation of 'My Shit Self'. The real thing is worse but only the people closest to me get to see that. For now it is the best/worst I can show you. The real 'My Shit Self' wouldn't make a video - she'd just be feeling sorry for herself in a corner somewhere. ---- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below? (1) You are shy (2) You used to be shy (3) You are secretly shy (4) You are shy when speaking a foreign language If yes, join Jade Joddle's email list: http://jadejoddle.com/join/
