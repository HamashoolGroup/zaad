LANGUAGE AND SUCCESS
Published on Jan 21, 2014
http://jadejoddle.com/join/ Your words and thoughts are powerful. Talking about how the grammar of what you say has a significant influence on your ability to reach your goals in life to achieve success. I explain to you the language of a failure - the way a person speaks that shows that they are not committed to their goal. This language also shows that a person is not really motivated to change. By watching your words carefully, you can change the way you speak and think. By changing your language, I show you how to change from a failure to become a winner. --- Do you fit any of the 4 groups below? (1) You are shy (2) You used to be shy (3) You are secretly shy (4) You are shy when speaking a foreign language If yes, join Jade Joddle's email list: http://jadejoddle.com/join/
