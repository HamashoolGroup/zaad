Published on Mar 22, 2016
Helen has just returned from her dream holiday and she's feeling fabulous. What about Finn, is he tempted to go on a break too? Will he get the special offer in time? Transcript: Finn Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Finn. Helen Hello everyone. I'm Helen. Finn You look a bit different today. Helen Oh, really? In what way? Finn Erm, you are glowing, you look so energised. Helen Really, I'm so flattered. I was invited to this amazing place on a tiny island by my friend. Finn Oh wow, so you were away for the weekend? Helen Oh yes. It's the best holiday I've had in years. Finn It sounds great. What was it like? Helen Sun, sea, just beautiful and tranquil. Finn Was it expensive? Helen It wasn't. It was actually about ?200 pounds for both of us including flights. You should think about going. Finn Wow, you know, you've sold it to me. Helen Em, but I don't sell holidays. I just make English learning programmes. Finn No, what I mean is that I want to go. 'You've sold it to me' is a very colloquial way of saying 'you've convinced me'. Here are some examples. Examples A: I lost five pounds after just a week on this new diet. It's definitely worth a try. B: You've sold it to me. I need to get in shape for my school reunion. A: Your phone looks amazing. B: It's brilliant, does everything, fab photos and great apps. AND it only cost me 10 pounds. A: 10 pounds. You've sold it to me. Where can I get one today? Helen If you're serious about going, you'd better hurry. I think the special offer ends today at noon. Finn What, I can't believe it. It's just past noon! Helen Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm sure there'll be another chance later. Finn Just my luck! Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/...
