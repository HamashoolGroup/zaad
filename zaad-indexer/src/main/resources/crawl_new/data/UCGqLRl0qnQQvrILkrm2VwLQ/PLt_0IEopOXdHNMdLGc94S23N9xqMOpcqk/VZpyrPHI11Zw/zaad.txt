6 Minute Basic Grammar: Past simple and past continuous - BBC Learning English
Published on Mar 6, 2016
In this session we've looked at the story of the Titanic disaster. We've learned how to talk about past events using the past simple and past continuous. It's time for 6 Minute Grammar with Rob, Emma and Finn to help you understand these two past verb forms. But what did Finn do last night? Listen to the programme to find out! Grammar When to use past simple We use the past simple to describe an action that happened and finished in the past. We commonly use it to give the order of events in a narrative. Example The Titanic struck the iceberg at 11.40pm. When to use past continuous We use the past continuous to describe an action that was in progress at a particular time in the past but not completed. We often use this tense with a specific time or together with another shorter event. Example The passengers were having dinner at 9 o'clock. How to make positive past continuous sentences The past continuous is made from subject + was/were + verb-ing. Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/...
