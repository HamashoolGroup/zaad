Published on Mar 4, 2016
When was the last time that you had to make a complaint? Was it in a restaurant perhaps? Maybe the food hadn't been cooked properly! Or was it in a hotel or shop? In this programme, we take a closer look at the language of complaining. When you have listened to the programme, don't forget to practise what you've learned with the activity at the bottom of this page. Making what you say more forceful Use absolutely with strong adjectives and really with weaker adjectives and verbs That's absolutely ridiculous! That's really unfair I really think that's unfair Signalling that you disagree Well... In a disagreement, well signals that you understand what someone is saying or asking you, but you have a different opinion or something unexpected to say. (If you say right or okay to show you understand, it can seem like you are agreeing with someone). Well I don't think it's fair to make us pay extra for the airport shuttle Well I have to say that the service was pretty slow, so I don't really feel like leaving a tip Well, there was a cockroach in my room and the bathroom door doesn't lock! actually... In a disagreement, 'actually' shows that you have a different point of view from the person you are speaking to or something unexpected to say Well, actually I don't think you should charge us for the starters I think you should give us the starters for free, actually Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/lea...
