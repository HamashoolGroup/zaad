Published on Mar 8, 2016
Finn and Catherine give you some tips which can help you to remember new words. In 6 Minute Vocabulary, you'll hear about a useful way of grouping words and learn a fun game to help you remember them. A lexical set is a group of words that share the same topic or theme and belong to the same part of speech - they are all nouns, all verbs, all adjectives (for example). Lexical sets are a useful way to organise vocabulary, making it easier to learn. When reading texts from different sources, it is a good idea to try to find groups of words that are related to the same topic and that belong to the same part of speech.
