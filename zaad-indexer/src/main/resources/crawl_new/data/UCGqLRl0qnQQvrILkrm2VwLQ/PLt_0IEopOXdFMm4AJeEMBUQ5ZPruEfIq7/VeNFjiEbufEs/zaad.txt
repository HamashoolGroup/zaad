Published on Mar 22, 2016
Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/lea... When you go to the cinema, does the sound of people eating popcorn and drinking noisily really annoy you? Movie-goers have plenty of bad habits, but what is the proper way to behave - or the etiquette -when you visit the cinema? Rob and Neil hear about two film critics who got so annoyed with bad cinema behaviour that they drew up a list of rules of what people should and shouldn't do at the cinema, and they talk about one very badly-behaved member of the audience. Vocabulary: etiquette: acceptable and expected behaviour in a particular situation multiplex: a large building that contains many separate cinema screens distractions: things that stop you concentrating on something else auditorium: the place in a cinema or theatre where the audience sits surround-sound: a system of three of more loudspeakers that allows the listeners to hear realistic sound all around them film critic: a person who writes about or broadcasts their thoughts about films dual screening: watching two different screens at the same time bad manners: unacceptable behaviour which doesn?t show respect for other people code of conduct: set of rules about how to behave in a certain situation bugbears: things that annoy or irritate you slurping: making a loud sucking noise when you drink something a big no-no: something most people don?t like
