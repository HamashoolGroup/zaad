Special thanks to Dan Hirons, Joey Seich and Carol Trieu for all your help, support and patience. To all my fellow travelers whose company made each step of the way all the more memorable and unique, I want you to know that however short an appearance you made in the video, you've left an impact far greater and long-lasting than the few seconds that each city appeared in the video. To my family, thank you for bearing with me and worrying about my health and safety with every dodgy bus ride and new country I found myself in each day.
