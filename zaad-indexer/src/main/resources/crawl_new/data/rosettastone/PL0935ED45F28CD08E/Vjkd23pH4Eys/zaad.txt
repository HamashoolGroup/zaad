European Journal | Ireland: Will the Irish Language Survive?
Uploaded on Dec 19, 2008
The Irish language, Gaelic, is a mandatory subject in schools and the constitution recognizes it as the country's first language. In some regions of western Ireland, it's still in daily use. But in the capital, Dublin, although Irish can be seen on street signs, hardly anyone speaks it. The country's national authority for the preservation of Irish Gaelic is doing all it can to keep the language alive by supporting kindergartens, newspaperps and even a television station. Critics say it's a waste of money for a dying language.
