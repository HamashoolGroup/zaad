Here is part 1 of a video series on this topic. When you are describing graphs and charts in your power point presentations you need a range of English expressions, verbs, adverbs and nouns, all with the correct collocation of prepositions. In this series of 3 videos I provide a variety of alternative phrases and sentences which will help you vary your presentation or discussion. This business language to describe your charts accurately is important also to emphasise trends, and make your positive figures sound impressive. The language range is also important to make your presentation interesting and keep your audience engaged in the content. Thank you for subscribing!
