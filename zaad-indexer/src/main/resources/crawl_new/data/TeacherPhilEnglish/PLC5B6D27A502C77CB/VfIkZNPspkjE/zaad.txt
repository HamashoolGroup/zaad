Uploaded on Jan 28, 2010
This English lesson is about 'happy and sad'. Tom asks Rusty if he is happy. Rusty says he is sad. Tom asks why? Rusty says he is sad because his Ipod is broken. I did not translate this lesson because it is pretty short and you can use Google Translate to search for meanings if you want.
