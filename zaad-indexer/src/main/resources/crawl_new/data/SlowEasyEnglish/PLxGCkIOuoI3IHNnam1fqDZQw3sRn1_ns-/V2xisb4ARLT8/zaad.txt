Published on Oct 14, 2015
*** This is a 360 degree video. Watch it in the YouTube app on your mobile device for best results. You can also watch it using the Chrome browser on your computer. (Not as good.) Also, if you can, be sure to watch it at the highest resolution possible.*** Everybody knows the answer to the old joke, "why did the chicken cross the road?" However, if you're chicken in Hanoi, you may never get to the other side. The traffic here is totally insane. It really needs to be seen to be believed. Many crosswalks don't have any traffic lights despite the never-ending stream of cars and motorcycles coming at you. And even at intersections where there ARE traffic lights, most drivers seem to be oblivious to them. With all this moto-mayhem, you might think that crossing the road here would result in certain death. However, once you get the courage to take that first step into the school of metal fish darting around you, you'll see that it's really not all that bad.
