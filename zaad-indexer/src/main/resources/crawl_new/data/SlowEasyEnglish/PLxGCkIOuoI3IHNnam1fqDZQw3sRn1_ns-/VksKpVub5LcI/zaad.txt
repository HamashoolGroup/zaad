Cost of living in the Philippines: Groceries in Manila
Published on Feb 4, 2016
Link to 2nd groceries video: https://youtu.be/sAe2mq_5oYQ What is the cost of living in Manila, Philipines? More specifically, how much does the food cost at the grocery store? In this video, I'll show you what I bought on my way home today and tell you how much I paid for each. This is what I bought: rice, mustard, bagels, Campbell's cream of mushroom soup, Campbell's tomato soup, Coke Light (same as Diet Coke in Canada/US), Lady's Choice mayonnaise, Tostito's nacho cheese sauce, Herr's tortilla chips, Bega cheese slices, bananas and Nips candy covered peanuts.
