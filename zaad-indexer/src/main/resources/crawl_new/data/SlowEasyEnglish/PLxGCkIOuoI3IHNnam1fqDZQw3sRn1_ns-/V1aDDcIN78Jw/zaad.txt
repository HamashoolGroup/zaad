Cheapest laundry service shop in Makati, Manila
Published on Mar 15, 2016
Laundry service in the Philippines is great, convenient and very affordable. Even the "expensive" shops will do your laundry for about 50 pesos per kilogram, which is only a little more than $1 USD. Cheap! But if you're near Century City Mall in Makati, you can get your laundry done for half that price!
