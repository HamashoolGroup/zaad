Daily Vlog #20: Vietnam! The boats in Mui Ne port fishing village
Published on Jan 11, 2014
We went to the fishing village at Mui Ne port and what did we see? Boats. Tons and tons of boats! It was very cool. Unfortunately, the smell wasn't so cool. It stunk like fish pretty bad and for me especially since I am not much of a fish guy. But still, it was cool to see!
