Insane intersection madness in Hanoi
Published on Oct 20, 2015
You HAVE to watch this video! If you saw last week's video about crossing the street and thought that was crazy, watch this. This really takes the the word "traffic" and gives it a whole new meaning! The intersections in Hanoi are absolutely insane. How they manage do it without a major pile-up every day is a mystery, but they do! And this small intersection is just one example of many, many more throughout the city and the whole country! Notice too that there are no traffic lights or stop signs!
