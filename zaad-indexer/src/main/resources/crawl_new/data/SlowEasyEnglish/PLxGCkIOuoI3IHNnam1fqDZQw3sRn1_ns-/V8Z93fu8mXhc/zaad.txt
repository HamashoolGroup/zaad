beautiful sky at sunrise in Japan (time lapse)
Published on Aug 28, 2012
This is a video of a beautiful sky during sunrise in Japan. The colors are gorgeous and I thought I would share it. Unfortunately, I caught it a couple of minutes later than I wanted to but it's still pretty nice. The original video was a little more than five minutes long and I condensed it into a little less than a minute and a half. Hope you like it. Enjoy
