Daily Vlog #24: Vietnam! Trying sugar cane juice
Published on Jan 16, 2014
After our walk through Fairy Stream, we saw that there was a woman selling some kind of juice. I suspected that it was sugar cane, but I didn't know that they made juice out of it. Interesting! Let's try it! Turns out, it was pretty good. Didn't taste like anything I've had before though. Just sweet, really. Kinda hard to describe. But pretty good. Try it!
