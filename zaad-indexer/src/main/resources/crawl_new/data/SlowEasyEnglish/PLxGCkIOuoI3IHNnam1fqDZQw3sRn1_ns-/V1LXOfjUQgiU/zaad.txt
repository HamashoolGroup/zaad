Very Cool Waterfall Illusion
Published on Sep 26, 2015
I learned about this very cool NATURAL illusion from my hiking guide while visiting the rice terraces in Batad, Philippines. One of the highlights of the tour was a trek to a beautiful waterfall nearby for a dip. (Did I say "nearby"? Actually, the hike took about an hour up and down the mountains. LOL) Stare at the center of the waterfall for about 30 to 45 seconds or so and then quickly look at the mountainside next to the waterfall. Can you see the illusion? It works best while you're actually there, of course, but I can also see the illusion on my little 13-inch laptop. The bigger the screen, the better. And next time you're at a similar-looking waterfall, try it in real life. It's very cool!
