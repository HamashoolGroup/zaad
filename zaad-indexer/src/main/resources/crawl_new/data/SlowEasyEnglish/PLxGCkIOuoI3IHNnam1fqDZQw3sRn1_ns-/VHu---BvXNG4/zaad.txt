Cost of living in Hanoi, Vietnam: My $350 apartment
Published on Oct 23, 2015
How much is rent in Hanoi? This video shows you what $350 a month can get you. The apartment is in a pretty good location and comes furnished. It's in Ba Dinh, which is about half-way between Hoan Kiem Lake and West Lake (Ho Tay) - both very popular locations for tourists and locals alike. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Hoan Kiem Lake and about 20 minutes to walk to West Lake.
