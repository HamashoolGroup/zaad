Photographer doesn't help subway man - takes pictures instead! (New York Post)
Published on Dec 5, 2012
A man was pushed onto the tracks of a New York subway yesterday and died moments later. A New York Post photographer thought it would be a better idea to take pictures than to help him. Not only that, the NYP ran one of the most horrific headlines I've ever seen. "Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die - Doomed!"
