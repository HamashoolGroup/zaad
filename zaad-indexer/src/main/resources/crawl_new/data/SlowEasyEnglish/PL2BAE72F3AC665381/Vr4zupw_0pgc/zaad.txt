Top 10 reasons the iPhone sucks!
Published on Nov 14, 2012
Here are my top 10 reasons the Apple iPhone sucks. 1. The timer doesn't have seconds. 2. Only the inbox is unified. 3. You can't print over wi-fi unless you have an "air print" printer. 4. You can only 'copy' photos to new folders. You can't actually 'move' them. 5. You can't lock or password protect individual apps. 6. You can't block calls. 7. There's no 'delete' button - only a 'backspace' button. 8. There's no 'undo' button. 9. You can't use it as a thumbdrive. You need to download an app for that. 10. You can't just drag-and-drop music and photos to your phone. You must go through a complicated process using iTunes. 11. (Bonus reason) The default when you add an event to the calendar is the date of the NEXT event you already have in it, not today's date. Why aren't these functions all already part of the phone's basic OS? It would be a relatively simple thing for them to add and would make life much easier for its users.
