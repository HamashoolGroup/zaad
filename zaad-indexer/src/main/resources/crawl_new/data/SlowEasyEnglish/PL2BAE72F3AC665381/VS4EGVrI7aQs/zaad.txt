Senkaku (Diaoyu) & Takeshima (Dokdo) disputes - How long is long enough?
Published on Sep 25, 2012
Japan's disputes with China and Korea have been on the news a lot recently over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu) and the Takeshima Islands (Dokdo). Both China and Korea claim that the islands should be returned to them because Japan took them illegally. But how long after claiming land is long enough? Land has been taken for the entire history of the world. Maybe we should go back 10,000 years and give all the land back to its original owners? http://www.sloweasyenglish.com http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
