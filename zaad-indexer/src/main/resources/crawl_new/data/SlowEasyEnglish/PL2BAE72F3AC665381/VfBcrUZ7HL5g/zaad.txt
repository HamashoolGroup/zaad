Hallowe'en (or Halloween) in Osaka Japan (Friday October 26th, 2012)
Published on Oct 26, 2012
A short video of the crowd in Triangle Park in Osaka, Japan on the Friday of Halloween weekend 2012. There's a part in the middle where I am talking to someone and it's very difficult to hear that part. Sorry about that.
