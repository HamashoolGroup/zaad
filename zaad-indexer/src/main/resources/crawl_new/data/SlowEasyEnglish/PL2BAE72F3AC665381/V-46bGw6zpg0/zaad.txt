Response to "Free Hugs for Korea-Japan Peace (?????????????????) "
Published on Aug 19, 2012
In this video, I talk about a cool, heartwarming video that I saw today. It's a Japanese guy who goes to Korea and in an effort to spread peace, not hate, he held up a sign with a Japanese flag and a Korean flag that said "Free Hugs for Peace". The link to his video is http://youtu.be/kXqWJNOAX8M Please check it out to show YOUR support for peace between these two countries!
