No Doubt video "Looking Hot" makes Native Americans angry, but why??!
Published on Nov 5, 2012
Some Native Americans complained last week about No Doubt's new video "Looking Hot", claiming it was offensive and racist because of its Cowboys and Indians theme. No Doubt removed the video the next day. I watched the video and there is nothing racist or offensive about it!
