Or meters to feet? If you are studying English, you probably live in a country that uses the metric system. But the U.S. uses the Imperial system, so it can be confusing when you watch Hollywood movies or if you travel to the United States. In this video, I teach you how to quickly and easily convert from one system to the other for a rough estimate.
