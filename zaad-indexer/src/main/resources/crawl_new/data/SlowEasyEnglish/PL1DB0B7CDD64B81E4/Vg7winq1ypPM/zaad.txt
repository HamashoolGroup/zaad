"Ending with a preposition" ESL English lesson: Talk like a native
Published on Sep 2, 2012
There is a famous grammar rule that you should never end a sentence or question with a preposition. A preposition is a word like, "of", "at", "for", "on", etc. There are actually some exceptions to this rule. Even the "proper" grammar allows for some sentences to finish in a preposition. This video looks at the standard form and teaches you how native English speakers say it in real life.
