The difference between debt and deficit
Published on Oct 20, 2012
In this video, I explain and show examples of the difference between "debt" and "deficit". I've noticed that a few TV personalities mix them up - even the President of the United States and Governor Romney! It's important to know the difference, especially at a time like this when the election is so close. http://www.sloweasyenglish.com http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
