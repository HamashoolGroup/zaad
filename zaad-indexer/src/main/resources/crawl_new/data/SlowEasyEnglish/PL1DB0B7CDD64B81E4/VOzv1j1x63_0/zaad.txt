Who or whom? The correct textbook grammar.
Published on Sep 2, 2012
In my previous video, I explained that most native speakers say "who" and rarely say "whom". Most native speakers don't even know which word is correct! Using "who" is always natural even if it isn't necessarily 'correct' according to the textbook. Your high school English teacher may not like it, but in real life, few people use "whom". For ESL learners of English, I recommend that they don't worry about it and just use "who" because that's how native speakers almost always speak. However, some viewers didn't find it helpful because they were looking for the actual "grammatically correct" answer. I didn't realize that some native speakers of English might watch the video looking for the answer. Maybe they are studying for a test or maybe they are simply curious. Whatever the reason, some people want to know the standard grammatical rule so this video teaches you the correct textbook way of using "who" and "whom". I hope you enjoy the video!
