The best way to learn English - Part 16: Stop translating!
Published on Mar 1, 2016
This is the 16th video in the series "The best way to learn English". If you haven't seen Part 15 yet, please watch it first. You might think that learning a second language is about being able to translate more and more quickly until you become "fluent". But that's not how language works. In Part 15, I talked about how the habit of translating at the word level can hamper your progress. In Part 16, I extend the discussion to translation at the sentence level.
