*** Read the conversation by clicking here: http://www.sloweasyenglish.com/?p=1623 *** Here in Japan, nobody has lawns. Most people live in apartments or condos and those that do live in houses, the lots are so small that there's no room for one. But for those of you who do have lawns, doesn't it seem like, no matter how well you take care of it, your neighbor's lawn always seems nicer than yours? This proverb is based on that.
