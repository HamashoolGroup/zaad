Idiom: What does "look over" mean?
Published on Mar 19, 2015
This one reminds me of a stupid joke I heard when I was a kid. Boy 1: What were you eating under there? Boy 2: Under where? Boy 1: Ewww! You were eating underwear??!!! Over course, you could make the same type of joke with "over where" and "overwear" but that wouldn't be as funny. Anyway, watch this video to find out what "look over" means!
