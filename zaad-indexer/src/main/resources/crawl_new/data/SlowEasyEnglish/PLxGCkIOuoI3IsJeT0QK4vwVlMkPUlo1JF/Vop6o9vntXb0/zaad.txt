*** Read the conversation by clicking here: http://www.sloweasyenglish.com/?p=1658 *** I remember when I used to watch Star Trek: The Next Generation, the crew would sometimes unwind by playing poker. But poker in the Star Trek future didn't make any sense because money didn't really have any value. Poker is not just about getting the right cards to make a good hand. Poker involves bluffing, and bluffing is meaningless without having something to lose. That's why you need a good "poker face" to play the game well.
