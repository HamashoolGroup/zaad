Idiom: What does "look up" mean?
Published on Mar 19, 2015
If you look up, you'll see the sky. Or the ceiling. It depends if you're inside or outside. But what if you look up something? Like a chimney? Then you'll see nothing. It's very dark in a chimney. Unless you have a flashlight. Then you'll see soot. A lot of soot. But "look up" doesn't mean any of these things. Watch the video to learn how to use "look up"! And if you're a single guy, just remember one thing. If a boy looks up a girl's dress, he's a pervert. If he looks up her address, he's a stalker!
