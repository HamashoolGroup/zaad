Idiom: What does "kick someone's ass" mean?
Published on Apr 9, 2015
Did you know that "ass" is another word for donkey? Why would anyone want to kick another person's donkey? I don't even know anyone who owns a donkey. How can I kick their ass if they don't have one? Of course, that's not at all what this idiom means. "Ass" doesn't even mean donkey in this case. Watch the video to learn what this idiom means and how to use it like a native speaker!
