*** Read the conversation by clicking here: http://www.sloweasyenglish.com/?p=1629 *** I wasn't sure whether to call this one an expression or a proverb. I decided to just call it an expression, but one could argue that this expression speak to morality and that it is a maxim, which would make it a proverb. Either way, the meaning is the same regardless of how you decide to classify it. ;-) Visit the website for 100's more videos! http://www.sloweasyenglish.com More Links: http://www.facebook.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.twitter.com/sloweasyenglish http://www.onlinephotodictionary.com ENGLISH LESSONS AND LISTENING IN SLOW EASY ENGLISH!
