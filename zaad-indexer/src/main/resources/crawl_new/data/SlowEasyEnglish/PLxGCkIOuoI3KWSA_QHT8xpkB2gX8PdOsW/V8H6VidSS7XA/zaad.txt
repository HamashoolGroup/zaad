How to raise a child music prodigy - learning music as a language (Part 2)
Published on Sep 13, 2012
In this video, I discuss my theory on how you could raise a truly amazing child music prodigy. In fact, with this method, I think it's very possible that not only could you raise a music prodigy, but doing so could also take music as we know it to a whole other level. This idea may seem similar to other previously mentioned ways of teaching music but is different in a very important way. The idea is for a child to learn music AS a language just as they learn their native tongue. This is NOT a simple comparison of how music is like language. I feel it's much more than that. Watch the video for details and explanation and then please feel free to discuss in the comments. I have never heard of an idea quite like this one proposed but it's possible that it is not new. If it isn't, I apologize for wasting your time and would appreciate any links on research like it. Normally, I upload videos on various topics in slow, easy English for ESL learners. This video, however, is not in slow, easy English. I speak with normal native pronunciation at a normal speed as it is intended for serious academic discussion rather than teaching or practicing the English language.
