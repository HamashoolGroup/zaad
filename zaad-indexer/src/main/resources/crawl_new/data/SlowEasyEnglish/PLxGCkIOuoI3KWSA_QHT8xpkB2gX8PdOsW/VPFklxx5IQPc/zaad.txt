Toronto Eaton Center 360 degree video virtual tour - Part 2 of 4
Published on Jun 16, 2015
*** Best viewed in YouTube app on your mobile device! *** This is a 360 virtual tour of the Toronto Eaton Center shot with a Ricoh Theta M15 360 degree spherical camera. This video will only display properly in the YouTube app on your mobile device (iPhone, iPad or Android phone or tablet), or you can use the Chrome browser on your PC. The best way to watch is is definitely on your tablet or phone in the YouTube app. You can move the camera around to look up, down, left and right! If you are watching on your PC with Chrome, you can use your mouse to pan in every direction. The video quality is not the best but it's pretty good considering the camera is only $300 and is very simple to use. Just one button to click and you can take a 360 degree video! Unfortunately, the camera can only take 3 minutes of video at one time so I had to break it up into four parts.
