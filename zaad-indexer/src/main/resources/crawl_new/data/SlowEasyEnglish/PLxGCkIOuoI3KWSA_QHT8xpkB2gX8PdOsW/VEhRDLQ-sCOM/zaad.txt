Take English lessons with me - now 50% off!
Published on Mar 24, 2016
Dear viewer, Thank you for being a subscriber to my channel. I?m glad that you enjoy my videos and I hope that they have helped you improve your English skills. Learning with videos is a great way to start. But videos cannot replace live lessons. Videos cannot tell you what YOU need. Videos aren?t personal. Videos can?t hear your mistakes. They can?t hear your pronunciation. If you want to get GOOD, you eventually need a real teacher that understands what you need and has the ability to teach it. This includes pronunciation - for both speaking AND listening. If you are ready to take your English skills to the next level, now is the perfect time to start. I am now offering online lessons for 50% off the regular price! If interested, click here for more information on pricing. http://www.sloweasyenglish.com/online... Thank you.
