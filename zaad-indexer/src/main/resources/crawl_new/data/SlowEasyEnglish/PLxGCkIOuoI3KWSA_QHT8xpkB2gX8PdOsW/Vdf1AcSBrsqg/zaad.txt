If you like Slow Easy English and find my videos helpful, please help others find my channel more easily! Most people searching for English lessons online are probably doing the searches in their own native language (not in English). Because of this, they may never find my channel. My channel is 100% English so foreign-language searches won't find it. If you like Slow Easy English, please help me make Slow Easy English easy to find by! You can do this two ways: a) recommend my channel and videos in English-learning forums (where people talk about English in a foreign language) b) help me translate the title, description and keywords for my video "The best way to learn English Part 1" into your native language I believe that doing these two things will make it much easier for people studying English to find this channel and learn English better and faster. These are the things I need translated: TITLE: The best way to learn English - Part 1 : What you need to speak English DESCRIPTION: This is the 1st episode in the video series "The best way to learn English". I speak SLOWLY and I use EASY words and grammar so that English learners can learn English IN English!

I also talk about some of the most common problems that students have when learning English and how you can overcome those problems.
