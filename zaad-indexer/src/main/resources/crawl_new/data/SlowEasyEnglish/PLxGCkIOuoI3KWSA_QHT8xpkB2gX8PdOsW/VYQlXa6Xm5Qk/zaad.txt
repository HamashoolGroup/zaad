Published on Aug 1, 2013
**** The full version is now up! Click here to watch: http://youtu.be/3SxpuSmGcbo **** I just got back from the PL Art of Fireworks show and wanted to upload a small sample to show everyone how awesome it is. I'll be uploading a longer and more complete version soon but I have to edit it first. P.S. The title "largest in the world" is dependent on how you count fireworks. If you count projectiles launched from the ground, then this is not the largest. But if you count the number of explosions it is, with 120,000 explosions! In Japanese, the name of the event is ???PL????. Enjoy!
