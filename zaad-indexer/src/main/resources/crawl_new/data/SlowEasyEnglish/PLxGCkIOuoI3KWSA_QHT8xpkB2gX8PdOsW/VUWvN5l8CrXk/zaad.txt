Walking along the edge of rice terraces in Batad, Philippines (360 degree video)
Published on Sep 27, 2015
This is a 360 degree video of me hiking through the rice terraces in Batad, Philippines. Remember that you can look up, down, left and right a full 360 degrees! To do that, you'll need to view the video in the YouTube app on your mobile device or in the Chrome browser on your computer. If you're watching on your mobile device, just move your device around to change the view. If you're watching this in Chrome, you can use your mouse to pan up, down, left and right.
