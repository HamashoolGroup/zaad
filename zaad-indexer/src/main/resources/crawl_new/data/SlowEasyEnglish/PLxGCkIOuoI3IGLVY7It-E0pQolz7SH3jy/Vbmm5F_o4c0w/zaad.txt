Published on Sep 27, 2012
Do you have trouble hearing the difference between the words "can" and "can't"? Many people do. That's because they sometimes sound very similar. Also, "can" can be pronounced two different ways and "can't" can be pronounced four ways! ***Note!*** Actually, I realized right after putting this video up that I forgot about [k?n], which sounds like the man's name "Ken". So, there are actually three pronunciations for "can"! Watch the video for a full explanation in slow, easy English.
