Published on Jan 9, 2014
Oh my... Time really does fly, doesn't it? It's already January 9th and I still have a bunch of videos from Vietnam that I haven't uploaded yet! I will do my best to get them all uploaded within the next few days. Here's a short one of people kitesurfing at Mui Ne beach, which is of course in Phan Thiet, Vietnam. If you like kitesurfing, this is apparently a very popular destination in South East Asia.
