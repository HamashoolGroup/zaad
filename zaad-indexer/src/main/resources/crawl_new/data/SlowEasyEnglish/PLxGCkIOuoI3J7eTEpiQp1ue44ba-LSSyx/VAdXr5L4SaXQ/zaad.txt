Daily Vlog #6: A short tour of Whity in the Umeda area of Osaka, Japan
Published on Dec 13, 2013
Yesterday, I went to Umeda, which is one of the main "city centers" in Osaka, Japan. I took some video in the underground shopping mall called "Whity". Unfortunately, the sound isn't that great. At first it's OK when the camera is facing me, but after I took the phone and used it to video away from me, the sound got kind of muffled. I think the phone uses a microphone only for the side that it's shooting. I'm not sure. But you can still hear me most of the time so it shouldn't be too big of a problem. You just might have to turn up your speakers a bit. That's all.
