I'm a Little Teapot Nursery Rhyme Song with the Can-can tune by Offenbach. Share with your friends. New Video Every Friday. SUBSCRIBE!!! Lyrics: I'm a little teapot short and round, I am. Here?s my handle to hold. Here?s my spout to pour out the tea. When I get all steamed up, hear my loud shout. Tip me over and then pour me carefully. I'm a very special teapot, look what I can do. Here, let me show you. I can change my handle and spout! When I get all steamed up, hear my loud shout. Tip me over and then pour me carefully. Drop the little teapot, break I will. Then you will end up with a spill. Be careful when you handle me! When I get all steamed up, hear my loud shout. Tip me over and then pour me carefully.
