Lyrics: Brush-a- tooth, brush-a-tooth, toothbrush-man Clean up my teeth as fast as you can Brush them, and floss them, and make my smile shine Then teach me how to brush for teeth that are so fine. Brush-a- tooth, brush-a-tooth, inside first, ?Cause the germs that get away are always the worst Backwards, and forwards, make sure you hit each one So you can have a smile that is lots of fun! Brush-a- tooth, brush-a-tooth, hit the tops So you can tell those nasty stinky germs to stop Sideways, and sideways, and cover every one So you can keep on chewing all your food for fun! Brush-a- tooth, brush-a-tooth, hit the tops So you can tell those nasty stinky germs to stop Sideways, and sideways, and cover every one So you can keep on chewing all your food for fun!
