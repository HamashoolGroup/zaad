Four little ducks went swimming one day, Over the hills and far away, Mummy duck said 'Quack, quack, quack,' But only three little ducks came back. Three little ducks went swimming one day, Over the hills and far away, Mummy duck said 'Quack, quack, quack,' But only two little ducks came back. Two little ducks went swimming one day, Over the hills and far away, Mummy duck said 'Quack, quack, quack,' But only one little duck came back. One little duck went swimming one day, Over the hills and far away, Mummy duck said 'Quack, quack, quack,' But no little ducks came swimming back. No little ducks went swimming one day, Over the hills and far away, Daddy duck said 'Quack, quack, quack,' And all the five little ducks came back.
