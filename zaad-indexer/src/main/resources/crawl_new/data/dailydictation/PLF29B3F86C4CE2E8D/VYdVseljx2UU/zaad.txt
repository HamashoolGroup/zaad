"Bugs Bunny Show" - pre-titles, titles, bumper and 1960s credits
Uploaded on Jun 5, 2009
Anyone who watched "The Bugs Bunny Show" on TV in the 1960s and '70s will enjoy seeing this again - "Overture, curtain, lights". The opening was reshot in color for broadcast and syndication in later years, but the remaining elements only exist in black-and-white.
