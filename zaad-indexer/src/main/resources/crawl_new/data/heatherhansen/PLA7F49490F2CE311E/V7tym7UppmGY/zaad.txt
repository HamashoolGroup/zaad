Uploaded on Jan 14, 2012
Visit http://www.englishpronunciationcourse... to sign up for the free, 8-part English Pronunciation Short Course! Are you worried about the way you speak? Do people have trouble understanding you? I'm Heather Hansen, and I'm a speech and communication specialist focusing on international English pronunciation. I've helped thousands of people -- just like you -- to speak more clearly and confidently. There are many reasons you might want to improve your speech. Maybe you want to land that international dream job, become a better public speaker, or just get your kids to stop making fun of you! Whatever your reasons, I'm here to help. English language courses rarely teach you the secrets to clear speech and how to be better understood. In the English Pronunciation Lab, I will be showing you exactly how to articulate sounds and words, and even more importantly, how to string those words together and emphasize the right parts so that you can make a greater impact. You won't find a better program for building your confidence speaking English. But don't take my word for it. Check out my testimonials page where members of this community have called the content in this course "top-quality", "amazing" and even "mind-blowing". Think how it might change your life! And the best part? You can sign up for my 8-part Pronunciation Short Course for absolutely free. That's free access to the secrets that my private one-on-one clients pay hundreds of dollars an hour to learn. So what are you waiting for? I don't care if it's 3 in the morning where you are. Enter your name and email in the registration box (at http://www.englishpronunciationcourse...) and let's get started! You'll be speaking more clearly and confidently sooner than you think! I'll see you in the lab!
