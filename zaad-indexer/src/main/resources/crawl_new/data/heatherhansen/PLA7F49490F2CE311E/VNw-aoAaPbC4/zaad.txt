Speak Global English - (Heather Hansen) recorded LIVE at Raise Your Game 2012

http://www.hansencommlab.com http://englishpronunciationcourse.com There are about 1.4 billion non-native English speakers in the world - and only about 400 million native speakers. In China, 300 million people peak some level of English and an additional 350 million are learning English. What's funny is the majority of them are learning American English, a language spoken natively by only about 280 million people in the world. 96% of English conversations in the world include at least one non-native English speaker. So, we can see that the world's English and English users are changing. Non-native English speakers are a huge majority, yet we continue to expect non-native speakers to sound just like us - the native speakers, the ones who speak "proper" English. Does that make any sense? We're failing to realize that a GLOBAL English is forming - one where the focus is on CLARITY not PURITY. Isn't it time to embrace this shift and start focusing on clear and confident communication instead of cutting people down for their speech??
