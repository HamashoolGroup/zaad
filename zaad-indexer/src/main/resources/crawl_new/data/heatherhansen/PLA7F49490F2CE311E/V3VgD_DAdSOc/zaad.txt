When I was growing up, my gymnastics teacher taught me that my body is capable of doing things much sooner than my mind will ever allow me to. I didn't realize at the time how much that lesson would apply to my life. Even in pronunciation, I watch my clients struggle (and I myself have struggled with foreign languages) to apply what they learn. This has nothing to do with how they articulate the sounds, because when they're with me, they do it perfectly. It has a lot more to do with their mindset around speaking English - the voices in their heads (parents, teachers, partners, kids, colleagues, bosses). Watch this video to learn my 4 steps to mastering your communication mindset. It's a little longer than normal, but I promise, it's worth every minute. Happy Speaking!
