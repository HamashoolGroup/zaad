Accent Tag - Shirley Taylor - Sheffield accent after living in Singapore!
Published on May 2, 2013
www.shirleytaylor.com www.sttstraining.com I couldn't resist a reply to Heather Hansen's video. Now, I'm Shirley from Sheffield who lives in Singapore. I've not lived in the UK for about 30 years, so my accent is a bit mixed up now. But when I go back to Sheffield, I'm Shirley from Sheffield again! Haha. In this video I'll take a look at all the words and questions on the Accent Tag list, and give you my take on them - from Sheffield Shirley, and from Singapore Shirley! Oh, and I also add a few of my own at the end, so do stay with me to find out how you would say some words I've added. Keep the videos coming! Shirley www.shirleytaylor.com www.sttstraining.com
