Today's word is CALENDAR. calendar (KAL-uhn-der) 3 syllables, word stress on the first syllable KAL There are two pronunciations that I often hear which aren't as clear as they could be. 1. Stress on the two first syllables: KAL-EN-der 2. Stress on the second syllable: kuh-LEN-der We should really try to put all our emphasis on the first syllable KAL. KAL-uhn-der. Notice how the 'e' in the middle almost disappears. Just pretend it isn't there. Go straight from the L to the N sound. L(uh)N. KAL-uhn-der. Let's use this word in a few sentences: Let me check my calendar. My calendar is really packed this week! I finally figured out how to synch the calendars on my computer and phone. So there you have it! Calendar - in under 60 seconds.
