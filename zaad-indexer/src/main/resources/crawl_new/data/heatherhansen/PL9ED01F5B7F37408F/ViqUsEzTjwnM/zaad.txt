Today's Pronunciation Quick Fix was suggested by a good friend and colleague who is based in Malaysia, Marianna Pascal. She is the author of the best-selling English Fast and Easy series, so if you haven't heard about her, be sure to check her out on Facebook! (For more information on Marianna Pascal's English Fast & Easy series, visit her Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Englis... ) Marianna wrote to me and said that she thought a great word for one of my "quick fixes" would be PROBABLY. Probably is 3 syllables with word stress on the first syllable, PRO. There is vowel reduction in the second syllable, 'buh'. Pro-buh-blee. There are some common errors with this word. Native speakers sometimes cut this word down to 2 syllables instead of 3, saying PRO-blee instead of PRO-buh-blee. This isn't the clearest pronunciation of the word, so I would always suggest to clearly articulate all three syllables. Let's use this word in a few sentences: We can probably come to the party on Saturday. You probably don't need to buy two of those. I think she's probably getting sick. There you have it! Probably - in under 60 seconds.
