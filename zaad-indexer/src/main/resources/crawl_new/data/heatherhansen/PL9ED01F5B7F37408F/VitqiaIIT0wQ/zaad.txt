How to Pronounce "COMMENT" (+COMMAND) - Pronunciation Quick Fix (Heather Hansen)
Published on Jul 16, 2013
http://englishpronunciationcourse.com http://www.hansencommlab.com Thank you Josef for this week's quick fix: COMMENT. Josef and his colleagues have been having long discussions about how to pronounce the word 'comment'. They were comparing it to another, similar word, COMMAND, and couldn't figure out why they don't have the same word stress pattern. I'm sorry to say, I don't have an explanation for you! COMMENT and COMMAND are two words that are exceptions to the "Word Stress in 2-syllable nouns and verbs" rule that I explain in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOcuw... COMMENT will always have its stress on the first syllable and COMMAND will always stress the second syllable. If you have a word you'd like me to address in a quick fix video, leave me a comment on one of my Facebook pages: http://www.facebook.com/hansencommlab http://www.facebook.com/englishpronun...
