Hi, I'm Heather Hansen, Clear Speech Specialist at English Pronunciation Lab, and I'm here today with your 60-second, Pronunciation Quick Fix. This is where I show you how to correctly pronounce a commonly mispronounced word in 60 seconds or less. Today's word is: PRONUNCIATION Pronunciation, Pronunciation... 5 syllables, word stress on the second to last syllable: pro-nun-ci-A-tion. This really is a quick fix because usually the problem with this word is that people confuse the pronunciation of the verb "to pronounce" with the noun "pronunciation". Let's take a look at the spelling. The word "pronounce" is spelled with an 'o-u-n-c-e' at the end. That "o-u" is what makes the OW sound - pronOUnce. Now look at pronunciation. There is not an "o-u", just a "u". "N-u-n," like a nun in a church. And that's exactly how it's said as well. Pronunciation. Let's use the word in a few sentences: "I need to practice my pronunciation" "What's the correct pronunciation of that word?" "Your pronunciation is great!" So there you have it! "Pronunciation" in under 60 seconds!
