Today I'd like to talk to you about the R and L sounds in English. These are some of the most challenging sounds for many of my Asian clients. First, let's look at the R sound. The R sound is made by rolling your tongue up slightly in your mouth. Don't roll your tongue too far. It shouldn't go past the vertical. Make sure the tip of your tongue does not make contact with an other part of your mouth. Looking at the L sound, the only difference is the placement of the tip of your tongue. Instead of rolling it up and not letting it touch anywhere, let the tip of your tongue move forward and make contact with the ridge behind your top front teeth. This is the only difference between R and L, and the main reason why the two sounds are so easily confused. If you'd like to practice with a tongue twister, try: Red lorry, yellow lorry, red lorry, yellow lorry. Repeat it again and again, quicker and quicker until it comes naturally for you! I hope this video has been helpful! I go into much more detail about the R and L sounds in my online Pronunciation Course.
