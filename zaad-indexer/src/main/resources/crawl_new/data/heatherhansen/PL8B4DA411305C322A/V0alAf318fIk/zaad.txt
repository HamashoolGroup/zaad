Speak Global English Video Series Part 16: Linking your words for better flow Listen to your favorite DJ or host, and you'll hear how smooth and fluent their speech is. They don't have that typical staccato rhythm we're used to hearing. Their speech sounds effortless. It just flows. This is because they've learned to link their words together. Words normally don't stand alone. If -- you- say -- every- word -- by -- itself -- it -- sounds- very -- odd. But if you link your words together correctly, your speech flows. Here are a couple ways you can link your speech: 1. If a word ends in a consonant and is followed by a word starting with a vowel, the consonant links onto the vowel. For example: "I'd like-a glass-of water" The K in like links to A and the S in glass links to of. "I'd lik-a glass-of water" 2. If a word ends in a vowel and the next word starts with a vowel, you add a Y or W sound between the two words. For example: "Why-yare you here? Not why // are, but whyyare.
