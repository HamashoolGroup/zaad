http://www.hansencommlab.com http://www.speakglobalenglish.org Speak Global English Series Part 1: What is Proper English? The first question people ask me when they learn that I'm an English speech specialist and communication strategist, is "What is proper English"? There are so many different kinds of English in our world. Which one should we use? This is a great question, and I'm going to make a lot of people very uncomfortable with my answer: There is no one, "proper" English! Did you get that? No matter how hard grammarians, English teachers and language snobs try to maintain rule and order in English, the language continues to change. The users of the English language -- you and me -- decide what is proper with every word and sentence we speak and write. Once enough people believe something is proper, guess what... it becomes a rule. This is exactly why we have so many different varieties of English. So does this mean we should ignore the rules and guidelines of English? No. It means we need to know and understand our listeners, and know how to adapt our speech to better fit their expectations. In international settings, our goal is no longer to be "proper", but rather to be "understood". However you get there is up to you.
