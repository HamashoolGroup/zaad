http://www.HansenCommLab.com http://www.SpeakGlobalEnglish.org Speak Global English Video Series Part 19: How watching TV can help you improve your speech What would you say if I told you that watching TV and listening to the radio could help you improve your speech?! It's true! The first step to improving your pronunciation is training your ear to hear the difference between different sounds. If you can't hear the difference it's much harder to produce the difference correctly on your own. As you watch TV or listen to the radio, be sure that you pay very close attention to how words are pronounced, not only individually, but also when they are strung together in sentences. Try watching and listening to shows from different countries and see if you can pick up on some of the pronunciation differences between different varieties of English. As you become a better listener, you'll be surprised how quickly you also become a better speaker. If you'd like to see more clear and confident communication in your workplace, well, you could try to mount a flat screen in every cubicle -- OR you can visit http://www.HansenCommLab.com for information on training opportunities. I also hope you'll join me in the Global English revolution at http://www.SpeakGlobalEnglish.org.
