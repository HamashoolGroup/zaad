You may not realize how closely linked your voice is to your emotions. If you feel uncomfortable or nervous or think that you need approval for the things you say, these feelings will often make themselves known in the intonation of your statements. Where many people run into trouble, is when they get nervous or feel insecure, and their statements begin to sound like... questions? I find that people do this the most in the beginning of public presentations when they are still feeling a bit nervous and are trying to get the approval of the audience. This unfortunately works against you, because you come across as insecure and like you don't really know what you're talking about. If you know what you want to say, and you feel strongly about something, be sure that your voice doesn't send another signal. Practice your introduction, paying specific attention to your tone until you can confidently deliver it without sounding like you're asking your audience for constant approval. You know what you want to say. Have the confidence to speak up and say it. Don't let your own insecurities get in the way. Say it like you mean it, and you'll find that people will take you and your ideas more seriously.
