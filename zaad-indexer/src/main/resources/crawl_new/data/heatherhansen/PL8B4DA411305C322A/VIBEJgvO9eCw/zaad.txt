http://www.hansencommlab.com http://www.speakglobalenglish.org Speak Global English Video Series Part 4 (of 22): Take Responsibility for your Communication One day on a social media platform, someone posted a picture that read, "I'm only responsible for what I SAY, not for what YOU UNDERSTAND." Argh! I could have screamed! In fact, I might have screamed. This statement couldn't be farther from the truth, and this attitude is exactly why so much of our communication fails. Communication is a two-way street. You are not only responsible for what you say, but also how what you say is understood. Plus you're responsible for making some effort in trying to understand other people. If you're a native speaker and have the attitude that "This is my language and it's your responsibility to speak in a way that I can best understand." Guess what, you're not going to make it very far in international business. And non-native speakers -- you're not off the hook -- if you don't have the confidence in your ability to speak and shy away from opportunities to make you ideas heard, you are equally guilty. So why don't we all start taking some responsibility for our communication and make a bigger effort to understand and be understood. If you agree, and would like to see a little bit more effort and understanding going into the communication in your international workplace, then visit me at http://www.HansenCommLab.com for more information.
