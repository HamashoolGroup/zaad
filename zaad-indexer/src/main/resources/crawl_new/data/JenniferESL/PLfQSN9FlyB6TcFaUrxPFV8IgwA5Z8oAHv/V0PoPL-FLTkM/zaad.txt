Uploaded on Dec 8, 2010
[Sorry for the double posting. This lesson had to be reloaded.] This version HAS CAPTIONS (subtitles). For the version with NO CAPTIONS, use link below: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U35oL5... TOPIC: A brief review of what gerunds and infinitives are, followed by a study of gerunds and infinitives as direct objects (the object of a verb). Special attention is given to the verbs TRY, STOP, FORGET, and REMEMBER and how their meanings change depending on whether they are followed by a gerund or an infinitive. LEVELS: High intermediate to advanced. NOTE: I'm very sorry to announce as of January 2012 links to EnglishCafe will no longer be active due to the site closing. I was very lucky to be a part of that online community while it lasted. I'm also sorry for the loss of additional materials for learners.
