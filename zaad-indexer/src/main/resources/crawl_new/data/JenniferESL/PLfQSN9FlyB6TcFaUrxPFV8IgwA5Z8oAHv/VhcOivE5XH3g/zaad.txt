Phrasal Verbs (Structure) - Lesson 18 - English Grammar
Uploaded on Oct 31, 2009
Topic: The structure of phrasal verbs. This is the second of a series of lessons on phrasal verbs (also called two-part verbs, particle verbs, and a number of other names). I explain how phrasal verbs can be transitive or intransitive as well as separable or inseparable. NOTE: I'm very sorry to announce as of January 2012 links to EnglishCafe will no longer be active due to the site closing. I was very lucky to be a part of that online community while it lasted. I'm also sorry for the loss of additional materials for learners. For teachers, I offer classroom ideas: http://englishwithjennifer.wordpress.... http://englishwithjennifer.wordpress....
