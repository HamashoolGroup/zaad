Topic: Yard Sales in the United States. This is a lesson in three parts. Part 2: Grammar NOTE: I'm very sorry to announce as of January 2012 links to EnglishCafe will no longer be active due to the site closing. I was very lucky to be a part of that online community while it lasted. I'm also sorry for the loss of additional materials for learners. TEACHERS: A related classroom activity is posted on my WordPress blog. http://englishwithjennifer.wordpress....
