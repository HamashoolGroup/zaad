Advanced English 4 - Part 1 (Listening) - Yard Sale
Uploaded on Sep 13, 2010
Topic: Yard sales in the United States. This is a lesson in three parts. Part 1: Listening practice. Suggestion: Advanced students should challenge themselves during the True/ False exercise. After each question, pause and provide not only the answer of "true" or "false", but also an explanation. NOTE: I'm very sorry to announce as of January 2012 links to EnglishCafe will no longer be active due to the site closing. I was very lucky to be a part of that online community while it lasted. I'm also sorry for the loss of additional materials for learners. TEACHERS: Related blog posts are available on my WordPress blog for all three parts of this lesson. The following post will offer ideas for presenting the topic of negative adverbs, which are contextualized in the listening passage. http://englishwithjennifer.wordpress....
