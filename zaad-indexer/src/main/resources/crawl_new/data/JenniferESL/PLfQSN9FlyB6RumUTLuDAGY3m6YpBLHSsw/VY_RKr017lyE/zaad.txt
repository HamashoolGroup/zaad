You can use the practice text for a dictation, a gapped text, or other form of classroom practice. For your convenience, here is the text you can copy and paste into a Word document. Where was I going? It began with a feeling, like music with no words. I stopped to listen, and I heard it clearly. It gave me an idea: to take a new road. Sometimes there can be pressure to stay in one place, but my desire to move was strong. Those closest to me supported me. I needed space to experiment and build something new. What would control my future, fear or a sense of purpose? I knew the answer. I stepped outside the box. ABOUT ME: Former classroom teacher. Published author. Online instructor.
