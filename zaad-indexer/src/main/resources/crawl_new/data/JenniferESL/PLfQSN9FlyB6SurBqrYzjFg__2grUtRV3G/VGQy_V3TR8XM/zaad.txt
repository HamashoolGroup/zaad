Published on Nov 24, 2013
Lesson for THIS clip begins at http://bit.ly/RealE81 - Click on "Exercise 1"! Music - "Memory Replaced" by Josh Woodward. Free download: http://joshwoodward.com/song/MemoryRe... The LESSONS for ALL of our videos are on the Real English? Site at http://www.real-english.com/ "Have you ever lived in another country or spent a month or more in a foreign country? Is there anything that you prefer or dislike about the U.S. compared to your country?" As you will see in the lesson for this clip, the answers to the questions provide motivating content for students of English as a Second or Foreign language at the intermediate levels. The exercises also show how the students learn with interviewees such as Sophia, whose native language is not English. Finally, you will see how the exercises are based not only the video, and its audio track, but also with the audio files provided by the Real English? teachers you meet in the lessons.
