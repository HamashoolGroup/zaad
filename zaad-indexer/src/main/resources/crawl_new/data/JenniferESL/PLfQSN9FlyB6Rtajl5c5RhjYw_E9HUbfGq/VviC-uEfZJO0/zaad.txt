#9 English Mini Lesson - Black Friday
Uploaded on Nov 18, 2010
Topic: Black Friday Learn more about U.S. culture and in particular the American holiday shopping season. Listen to interviews with a native and non-native speaker. We will also study vocabulary related to retail and finance. Levels: high intermediate to advanced NOTE: I'm very sorry to announce as of January 2012 links to EnglishCafe will no longer be active due to the site closing. I was very lucky to be a part of that online community while it lasted. I'm also sorry for the loss of additional materials for learners. TEACHERS: Related teaching ideas are posted on my WordPress blog. http://englishwithjennifer.wordpress....
