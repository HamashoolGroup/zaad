Part 1 of Home Improvement Series. Watch series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... Support my channel with paypal: kae.bowman@gmail.com thanks hi everybody, thanks for watching. In this video you will learn how to talk about using a roller brush to paint the walls. Handy verbs: to roll, to look + adjective, to take a break from doING something, to pause, to share with you, to change something from A to B. Phrasal verbs: the paint goes on the wall, to set up the ladder, to cover up the white mud with the paint. Vocabulary: evenly, bristles Patterns: comparison: a roller brush is faster than a brush, to start painting (start + verb ING), I can start painting now, let's start painting now; in my opinion.
