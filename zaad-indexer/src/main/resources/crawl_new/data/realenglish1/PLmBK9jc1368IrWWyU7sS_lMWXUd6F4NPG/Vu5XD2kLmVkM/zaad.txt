Changing "the Machine" - CC Double
Uploaded on Feb 23, 2010
All the Real English Lessons begin here: http://www.real-english.com/new-lesso... A "CC Double" video is made up of 2 parts. First you see the video with subtitles, followed by the same video WITH SUBTITLES. Barack Obama as perceived by people we met on the street in South Beach Miami. This is for upper intermediate and advanced students. The lessons I make for this clip will make it accessible to average intermediate students. A French friend once asked me "Why is the USA the only developed country in the world where health care is a profit-making industry?" This clip does not answer that question, but it provides a good hint concerning the answer. I wonder myself about this question. Can't we do the same as European countries without being accused (!) of being socialists? Why not put essential care first, and the financial question second for once?
