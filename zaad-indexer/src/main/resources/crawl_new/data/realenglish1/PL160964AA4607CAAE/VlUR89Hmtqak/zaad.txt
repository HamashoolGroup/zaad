What is Real English? ? Revised Version
Published on Mar 17, 2012
This clip gives you a good general idea of the video content of Real English?. http://www.real-english.com/new-lesso... However, the interviewers in this clip are all subtitled in English, and we encourage students not to watch the versions with subtitles until after watching the same videos WITHOUT subtitles in order to increase listening comprehension and better pronunciation. In the next video (coming soon!) we will show you how the Real English LESSONS work with our videos.
