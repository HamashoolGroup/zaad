Uploaded on Jan 30, 2008
Lesson for this video begins at http://www.real-english.com/reo/22/un... A "Lesson" is a collection of interactive quizzes for a single video. Everything is free and free access. The Summary Page for ALL of our lessons is here:? http://www.real-english.com/new-lesso... What is the difference between "What do you do?" and "What are you doing?" This very short video shows that sometimes they are used to mean the same thing, but there is an important distinction. To *simplify*, "Doing" is NOW, and "Do" is every day, for example. This is a "CC Double" - A "CC Double" video is composed of two parts: 1 - The regular video, followed by 2 - The same video with subtitles. Students of English: To improve your pronunciation, always study the version WITHOUT subtitles before reading the subtitled versions!
