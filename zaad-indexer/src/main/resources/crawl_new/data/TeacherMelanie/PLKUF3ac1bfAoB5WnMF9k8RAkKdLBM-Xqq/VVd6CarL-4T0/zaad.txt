How to say "What time is it?" like a native speaker
Published on Dec 3, 2015
http://www.englishteachermelanie.com/ Say it like it's all one word with four syllables: wha ti mi zit or w? 'ta? m? z?t. When you say this sentence, you need to link the T at the end of WHAT and at the beginning of TIME (you only need to say the T once). You also need to link the M at the end of TIME to the I at the beginning of IS, and the Z sound at the end of IS to the I at the beginning of IT. This is your English sentence of the day. Learn how to understand natural spoken English AND learn how to sound more like a native speaker. Every day I upload a new sentence for you to practice. http://www.instagram.com/TeacherMelanie http://www.twitter.com/TeacherMelanie http://www.facebook.com/EnglishTeache...
