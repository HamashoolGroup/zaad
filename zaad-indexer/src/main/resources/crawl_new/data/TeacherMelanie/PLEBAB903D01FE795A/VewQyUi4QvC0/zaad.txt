'th' /?/ & /?/ vs. / t / & / d / - American English Pronunciation Lesson
Uploaded on Sep 11, 2010
http://www.englishteachermelanie.com Do you say / t / and / d / instead of 'th' ( /?/ and /?/ )? This is a common pronunciation mistake in English (most common with Spanish and Portuguese speakers), because the English 'th' sounds do not occur in most other languages. To make the 'th' sounds, make sure your tongue comes out through your teeth. There are two 'th' sounds in English: /?/ is the unvoiced sound, meaning just air comes out of your mouth; /?/ is the voiced sound, meaning your vocal chords make a sound. In this video, I help you practice the difference between the 'th' sounds and the 't' & 'd' sounds. Part 1 -- Minimal Pairs /?/ vs. /t/ Part 2 -- Which word do you hear ? Part 3 -- Words & Phrases with /?/ and /t/ Part 4 -- Minimal Pairs /?/ vs. /d/ Part 5 -- Words & Phrases with /?/ and /d/ If you liked this video: - Leave me a COMMENT - LIKE this video! - SHARE this videos with your friends on TWITTER, FACEBOOK, or GOOGLE+!
