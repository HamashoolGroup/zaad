This is a very common mistake for Russian, French, German, Chinese, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, and Vietnamese speakers. The English 'th' sounds do not occur in most other languages. To make the 'th' sounds, make sure your tongue comes out through your teeth. There are two 'th' sounds in English: /?/ is the unvoiced sound, meaning just air comes out of your mouth; /?/ is the voiced sound, meaning your vocal chords make a sound.
