Bem vindo ao Meu Apartamento | Portuguese: One month challenge
Published on Jul 14, 2013
My second video in my continuing series about learning Portuguese in one month. Even in two weeks I've managed to learn more than I thought possible. This was a good way for me to practice possessives and the present tense. Introducing your apartment is an excellent way to practice language, as it's a place you are comfortable with and like talking about. Thanks for watching my videos!
