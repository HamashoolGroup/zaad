First Portuguese conversation (Unedited version) | Portuguese one month challenge
Published on Jul 22, 2013
This is my full, unedited conversation I had with a native speaker of Portuguese on July 19th, less than 3 weeks after beginning to learn. This Portuguese conversation was very difficult for me, but it shows that speaking in a new language early is not only possible, but necessary!
