Aprender Portugu?s | Learning Portuguese: One month challenge
Published on Jul 6, 2013
Al?! This is the first video in my series of learning portuguese! I am trying to hack language to learn a lot in a short time. This video is mostly to get over my fear of speaking and to just start producing language! I believe producing is the most important part of language learning! Please keep in mind that this was scripted and not just from my head. I just wanted to practice. Please, like, share or subsribe to my videos as I update things frequently with my thoughts and discoveries as I try to learn as much as possible in only one month!!
