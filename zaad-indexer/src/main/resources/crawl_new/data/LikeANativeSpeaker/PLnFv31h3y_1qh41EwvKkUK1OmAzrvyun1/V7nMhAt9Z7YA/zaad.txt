What Is A Native Speaker? | Like A Native Speaker
Published on Jul 17, 2014
There are 360 million native English speakers right now. Every single one of them sounds different. I believe that sounding like a native speaker does not mean that you have to remove your accent, or never make a mistake. I believe that sounding like a native speaker means being comfortable and confident in whatever ability you have, from beginner to advanced! Ian Schellenberg is an English teacher and teacher trainer in Vancouver, Canada with a passion for languages. He enjoys learning and teaching all of the fine nuances of any language. Ian is an expert in pronunciation and the history of English. SUBSCRIBE http://bit.ly/143yXED Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/LikeAN...
