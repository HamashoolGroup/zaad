Sing Out Loud Traditional Songs LYRICS: HOME ON THE RANGE 1. Oh, give me a home, where the buffalo roam, where the deer and the antelope play, where seldom is heard, a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day. (CHORUS) Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play, where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
