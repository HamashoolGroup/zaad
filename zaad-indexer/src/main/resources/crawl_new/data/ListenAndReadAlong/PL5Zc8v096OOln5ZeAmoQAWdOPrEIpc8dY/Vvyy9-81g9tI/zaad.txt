Songs - Traditional - Down in the Valley
Published on Feb 7, 2014
DOWN IN THE VALLEY 1. Down in the valley, the valley so low, hang your head over, hear the wind blow 2. Roses love sunshine, violets love dew; Angels in heaven know I love you. 3. If you don't love me, love whom you please; Put your arms around me, give my heart ease 4. Write me a letter, send it by mail; Send it in care of the Birmingham Jail. 5. Birmingham Jail, love, Birmingham Jail; Send it in care of the Birmingham Jail The first verse is repeated. Down in the valley, the valley so low, hang your head over, hear the wind blow.
