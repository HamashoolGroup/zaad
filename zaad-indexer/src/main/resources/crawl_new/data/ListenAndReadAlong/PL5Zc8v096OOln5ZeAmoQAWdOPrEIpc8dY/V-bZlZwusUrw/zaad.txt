Published on Sep 12, 2013
A cowboy driving calfs and cattle to Wyoming...knowing they are heading to someones dinner table... Well, As I was walking one morning for pleasure well, I spied a young cowboy a-riding along well, His hat was shoved back and his spurs were a-jingling And as he was ridin' he was singin' this song Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies It's your misfortune ain't none of my own Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies You know that Wyomings goin be your new home It's early in the springtime we round up those dogies We cut'em mark brand 'em and bob off their tails Round up the horses, load up the chuck wagon And Then throw the dogies out on the north trail Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies It's your misfortune and none of my own Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies You know that Wyoming will be your new home Well your mother was raised way down in Texas Where the jimson weed and those chollas grow we'll fill you up on those prickly-pear briars Until you are ready for Idaho Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies It's your misfortune ain't none of my own Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies You know that Wyoming's gonna be your new home Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies It's your misfortune ain't none of my own Whoopie ti yi yo, git along little dogies You know that Wyoming will be your new home
