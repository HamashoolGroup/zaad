Seven Man-Made Wonders in the US The Golden Gate Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Gateway Arch, Mount Rushmore, Hoover Dam, the Mesa Verde Cliff Dwellings, and the Space Needle There are many natural wonders in the United States. Today, we take you to seven man-made wonders in America.Against the city's gleaming spires, Above the ships that ply the stream, A bridge of haunting beauty stands -- Fulfillment of an artist's dream. That poem is about our first man-made wonder -- the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. It extends more than 480 meters over the East River to connect the areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan. A famous bridge builder David B. Steinman wrote the poem. But he did not build the Brooklyn Bridge. It was the dream of another man, John A. Roebling. He was a member of the design team and became chief engineer of the building project in 1867. Sadly, he became sick and died before work even started. He had an accident when visiting the area where the bridge was to be built Its towers pierce the sky.Our next man-made wonder is as famous a landmark in the Midwest United States as the first two are on the East and West Coasts. The Gateway Arch in Saint Louis, Missouri is the tallest freestanding monument in the nation. The shiny, steel curve rises to almost 200 meters. Below, the arch is exactly as wide as it is tall. The famous Finnish American building designer, Eero Saarinen, designed the Gateway Arch during a national competition in the late 1940s. However, building did not begin until February, 1963. It was completed in October, 1965. Later a transport system was added to permit people to visit an observation area inside the top of the arch. The Gateway Arch rises above the Mississippi River This is a VOA product and is the Public Domain. It has been edited and made available by manythings.org
