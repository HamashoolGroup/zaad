Stories - Autobiography of Mark Twain - Chapter 00 - Preface
Published on Apr 19, 2013
From the Preface. In this Autobiography, I shall keep In mind the fact that I am speaking from the grave.... I shall be dead when the book issues from the press.... It seemed to me that I could be as frank and free as in a love letter if I knew that what I was writing would be exposed to no eye until I was dead, and unaware, and indifferent.
