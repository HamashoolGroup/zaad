We also tell about efforts to develop medicines from underwater organisms. And we tell about a newly identified species found in the Caribbean Sea. ** Story 1 ** A new system has been developed to measure the health of the world's oceans. Scientists say the system will change the way we think about oceans and how they affect our lives. It is called the Ocean Health Index. The index is designed to tell if anything is wrong with the oceans and, if so, what can be done about it. ** Story 2 ** Chemist Mande Holford has an unusual partner in her hunt for new medicines: a fierce, little snail that eats fish. But she admits that her studies of the creature are not all scientific. "I fell in love with snails because their shells are gorgeous." Yet the tongue-like proboscides of the snails are deadly. They inject their victims with venom made of poisonous chains of amino acids called peptides.
