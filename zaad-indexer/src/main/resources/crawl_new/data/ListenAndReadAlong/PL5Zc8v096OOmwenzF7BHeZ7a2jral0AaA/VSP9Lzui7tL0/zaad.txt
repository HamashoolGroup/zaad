S. spokesman, John Kirby, said Monday Washington has been in ?close contact? with Moscow ahead of another international meeting in Munich. ?We have talked a lot about this with them and you heard the secretary address this very issue on Friday and and that's why he believes this upcoming meeting in Munich is important. On Thursday to deal with this exact issue. And he's been very clear that Russian support for the Assad regime is doing nothing but prolonging the conflict. Helping attract jihadis and foreign fighters to the effort. Obviously its increasing the flow of refugees and it's harming innocent people.? Turkey's deputy prime has warned his country may face another six hundred thousand Syrian refugees. on top of the two and half million it's already sheltering. Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto?lu said Ankara in Germany may seek greater NATO involvement. Meanwhile, the U.

Ethnic rivalries and competition for mineral rich land have stoked persistent conflict among eastern Congo's dozens of rebel groups. This is VOA news.
