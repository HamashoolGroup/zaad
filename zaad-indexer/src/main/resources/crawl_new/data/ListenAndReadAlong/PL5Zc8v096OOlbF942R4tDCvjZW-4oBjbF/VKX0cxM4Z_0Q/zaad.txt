AS IT IS - US - Maine - End of Cod - 13 Feb 2013

AS IT IS 13 Feb 2013 US - Maine - Cod Fishing Diseaster For hundreds of years, the waters of the Gulf of Maine in the northeastern United States have provided many codfish. But the numbers have mysteriously decreased. Scientists are not sure why. At risk are both the fish stocks and the people who depend on them. Mario Ritter has the story. After almost 40 years of fishing, David Goethel says this season may be his last. That is because the New England Fisheries Management Council reduced the number of cod that can be caught in the Gulf of Maine by 77 percent. David Goethel says that means fishermen are unable to make a living. "For us, it basically means we are all done." He says that under the new limits, he would reach his cod quota in just a few days of fishing. And other fish are effectively out of reach for his kind of boat and equipment. The size of the catch today is just a small part of what it was 50 years ago. But the council's decision is hard on people like David Goethel, who have kept on fishing. He says that if the fishermen do not work, they do not eat. John Bullard heads northeast fisheries at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says the Council members knew the limits would be painful, but necessary so that the cod population can recover. "But they (the council) felt it's the only chance we have to bring back these stocks. We have to do this. If we don't do this, then there's no chance." Scientists are finding fewer and fewer cod in the Gulf of Maine. Some scientists have blamed climate change. Also, the remaining cod may be too small to produce enough young to rebuild the population. At the same time, the environment seems better for other creatures, like lobster. David Goethel says the cod will be back when the waters cool down. But he says he is not sure he will be there to see them. This is a VOA product and is in the public domain
