AS IT IS - India - Tiger Tourism 20130213
Published on Feb 13, 2013
AS IT IS - 13 Feb 2013 In India population growth has pushed many villagers into territory that traditionally provided a homeland for tigers. Predictably that made the beautiful but dangerous animals most unwelcome. But things have changed. On a recent day visitors to the Corbett National Park occupied all 63 rooms at the Riverview Retreat Resort. The park is Indias oldest protected wildlife area. Riverview Retreat chief Pan Singh Bisht has been working late to take care of the many visitors. He says business suffered when Indias Supreme Court banned tiger tourism last July. But now he says the tourism season is in full progress. The court declared the ban after studying a petition signed by people who said visitors were harming tigers. At last count there were only about 1700 of the animals left. The ban was lifted after wildlife activists argued that tourists do not threaten tigers. Instead they said the real threat comes from poachers, people who kill tigers for their skin and other body parts. The activists say visitors created much needed jobs for local communities. Chandan Kumar works as a waiter in the restaurant at Riverview Retreat. The park has almost 100 hotel resorts which employ him and many others to care for tourists. In the late 1980s villagers expanded into the forest in search of farmland. That brought local populations into conflict with tigers and other wild animals. Poachers targeted the big cat to supply the Asian medicine market in tiger parts. Understandably the local communities did not care very much about the animals. But a resort wildlife officer who grew up in the area says village economic and living conditions have improved greatly. Now they see benefit. And now he says the villagers want to protect the tiger.
