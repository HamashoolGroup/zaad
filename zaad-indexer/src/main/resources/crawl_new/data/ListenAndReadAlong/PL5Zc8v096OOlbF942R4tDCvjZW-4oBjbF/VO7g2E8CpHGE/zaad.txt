AS IT IS - 1 Feb 2013 - China's 1 Child Policy Australian researchers say a new study measures how China's one-child policy has affected generations of people. The study was published in Science Magazine. It has the term "Little Emperors" in its name. Kelly Jean Kelly explains that the name suggests that the one-child family has produced people who demand to get their own way. The Australian researchers studied 421 adults in China. The researchers compared people who were born before and after the one-child population control policy began in 1979. The research team designed games and questions to understand behavior and personalities. One test was called the "trust game." In the game, one person was given some money. He or she could give some of that money to a stranger as a donation or investment. The social scientists found that those born under the one-child policy would give less money. And, people born under the one child policy also returned less to the person who gave them the money, even if they had earned a profit from it. Team researcher Nisvan Erkal is an associate professor in the department of economics at the University of Melbourne. She says the one-child policy has affected generations of Chinese. "Those people born under the one-child policy and who are single children as a result of the policy are significantly less trusting, less trustworthy, more risk-averse and less competitive." Ms Erkal says there is talk in the country about ending the policy. Still, the effects of the one-child policy could take a long time to change.
