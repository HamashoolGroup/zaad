Biography - SR - Ravi Shankar - Godfather of World Music
Published on Dec 16, 2012
This month, the world lost a special Indian musician, Ravi Shankar. The VOA's Elizabeth Fuller has more on the musician's life. "Ravi Shankar has been called India's greatest cultural ambassador. He died on December 11 in the American state of California at the age of 92. Ravi Shankar was the first Indian musician to become famous in the West. He played the stringed instrument called the sitar. The Indian sitar player influenced many musicians, including the former Beatle, George Harrison, who called him 'the godfather of world music.' He won three Grammy Awards and has been nominated for a 2013 Grammy for his album, The Living Room Sessions, Part 1. The former Indian ambassador to the United States, Lalit Mansingh, says Mr Shankar brought positive attention to India at a time when not too many people were interested in the nation. 'Not very long after independence, India's democracy was still an experiment, its economy was in shambles, and India in the West was routinely described as a black hole or a basket case. So what Ravi Shankar did was to project the idea of India as a country that is rich in culture and which had a future.' Ravi Shankar began playing in the West after receiving a lot of traditional training in India. But he broke the traditional sounds as he experimented with mixing different sounds of Indian music with Western classical and jazz styles. As he played with top rock bands in the West, he hoped to close the musical division between different cultures. In India, he will be remembered as one of the world's greatest musicians as well as the nation's most famous musical son." That was the VOA's Elizabeth Fuller. Her report included information provided by VOA reporter Anjana Pasricha, who reported from New Delhi, India.
