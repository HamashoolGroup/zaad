I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. Day 17, we are talking about the difference between the English words say and tell. There are a few say phrases and a few tell phrases to memorize, but don't worry...I will simplify for you :) Enjoy! _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak!
