English Lessons With Kristen - http://tipsyyak.com/learn ? 30 Days of English Hub - http://tipsyyak.com/30-days Welcome to 30 Days of English! Let me first say that I am so excited to have you here. I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 3, we are talking about the difference between things happening now and things that happen regularly or things that never change and things that are only temporary. I want to help you give more accurate meaning when you speak through this video :) Some people call these verb tenses Present Simple and Present Continuous or Present Progressive...but don't worry about those stupid titles :) Enjoy! _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different. My goal is to bring you constant education in a practical and entertaining way.
