I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 20, we are talking about prepositional phrases in English. I know you probably know most of the English prepositions, but you might need to work on where they usually go in an English sentence. So, let's get going on the grammar of English prepositional phrases :) Enjoy! _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different.
