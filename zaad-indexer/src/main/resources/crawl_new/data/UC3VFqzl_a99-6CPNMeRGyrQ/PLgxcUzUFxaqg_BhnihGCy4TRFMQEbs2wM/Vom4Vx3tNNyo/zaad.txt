Let me first say that I am so excited to have you here. I have worked my butt off to come up with the 30 most common 'things that make you crazy' about English and have found a way to explain each of them in the Tipsy Yak way... with a drink, a laugh and of course, without boring or complicated crap. On Day 14, we are talking about the definite article the in English. We use the word the all the time. I will help you pronounce it, show you when and why to use it instead of a or an...and give you some examples to make it clearer. English articles might be weird to some people because you don't have them in your language...I hope this video helps you :) Enjoy! _ Hey Friends! I'm Kristen, welcome to Tipsy Yak! Tipsy Yak is all about being real and different. My goal is to bring you constant education in a practical and entertaining way. Just click "CC" if you need to read along as I speak.
