Today, we're doing a lesson on: "have" and "have got", and the differences between these two grammatical constructions, and when we use them. Okay? So I'm going to be talking through the different uses of: "have" and "have got", which tenses we can use, whether it's past, present, or future, and then looking at the form; exactly how we make sentences using: "have" or "have got". As a generalization, here in the UK, we prefer to say: "has got" rather than "has". Missing a little mark there. So, I might say: "David Cameron has got an important job." Whereas in the US, they might say: "Barack Obama has an important job." Okay? So that's just a small little difference you might want to think about. It's not important though, don't worry too much about it. When we're talking about the possessive, when we're talking about things you own-okay?-property, you can use both: "have" and "have got". So, for example: "My friend, Joanna, has got a beautiful house." Or I could use: "have". "Billy has a big horse." Okay? So I can use both: "has got" and "has". Yeah? Pretty, pretty plain sailing? Obviously, if it's not "he", so this is "he", if it was kind of "they", then it would be: "They have a big horse." A big horse. Now, how do I ask questions about the possessive? Well, if I'm using: "have", I take this form: "Do you have a carrot?" Because Billy's horse is hungry. Okay? "Do you have", and then my object here. "Do you have?" If I'm using: "have got", then I put "have" and this is kind of my subject. "Have you got a mortgage?" Okay? So: "Do you have...?" or: "Have you got...?" Okay? Something to remember. "Do you have...?" or: "Have you got...?" Now, when I'm using actions: "have" I use when I'm talking about something that is a habit. For example: "I usually have a shower after going to the gym." Okay? "I usually have Weetabix in the morning." So these are things that I do quite often. "Have got", it's slightly different when I'm talking about an action and "have got". So: "I have got to go to the toilet after this lesson." Okay? "I have got to go to the bank tomorrow.", "I have got to telephone my mother and say: 'Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah', about Christmas." Okay?
