Russian Instrumental case - functions, forms, ???????????? ????? ? ???????
Published on Nov 12, 2015
It's time we talked about the instrumental case! It is the fifth case in the Russian case system and it is used quite often in the Russian language so we need to know it quite well. There is an exercise at the end so be patient and make sure to do it! Study English and Russian weekly! My channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniaRo...
