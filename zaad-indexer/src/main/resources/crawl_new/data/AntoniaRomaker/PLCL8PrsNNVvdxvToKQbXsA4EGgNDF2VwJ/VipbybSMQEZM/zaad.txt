SeriesEnglish Story #2
Published on Dec 2, 2012
In this lesson I tell you about fanfiction about "How I met your mother" and a little story about Josh Radnor (Ted). Of course to make the lesson more effective I provide you with some useful language, found in the material I worked with. p.s. The actor is Josh Radnor, so I am terribly sorry that I have mispronounced the name!!! Hope that Josh will find the way to forgive me...)
