#51 Russian verbs - ??? ????????, I like
Published on Jun 18, 2014
I this video you will find information about the Russian verb "?????????", it is actually very different from the English "like", so that's why I decided to devote a whole class to it. And maybe not one. English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday! My channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniaRo...
