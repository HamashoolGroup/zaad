Published on Jan 7, 2015
One more class, devoted to the New Year! Here you will learn what basic traditions Russians follow during the New Year celebrations. Some of them are rather cliches than traditions, but it doesn't make them less interesting! p.s. Merry Christmas! English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday!
