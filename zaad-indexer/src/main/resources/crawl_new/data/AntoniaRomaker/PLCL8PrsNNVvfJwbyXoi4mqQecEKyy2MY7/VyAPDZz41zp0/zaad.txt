#48 Russian prepositions 2 - ?, ?? - in, at, on - russian vocabulary
Published on May 28, 2014
This is the second lesson, devoted to Russian prepositions, and here we will once again talk about "?" and "??", but mostly "??". This preposition cannot be considered the equivalent of "on", as sometimes it can be translated "in" or "at". English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday!
