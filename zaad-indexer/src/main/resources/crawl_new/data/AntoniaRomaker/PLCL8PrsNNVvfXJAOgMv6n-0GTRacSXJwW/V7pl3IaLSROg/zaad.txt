#69 Russian alphabet: letter ?, vowel - ? ???!
Published on Oct 22, 2014
The russian letter '?' is a little bit specific, that's why I have decided to devote a whole class to it today! Sometimes it can be written as '?', that is without the dots, but the pronunciation does not change. How cen we know? When does ? actually mean ?? Let's find out! English - every Monday! Russian - every Wednesday! My channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniaRo... My group - http://vk.com/RusWithPas My facebook group - http://www.facebook.com/groups/RusWit... The text at the end of the class: ???? ??? ????? ????????? ??????? ?????????. ??????? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????????. ?? ?????? ????? ?????? ???????. ??? ??????? ??????? ???? ??????? ?????, ?????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????, ??? ??? ???? ?? ???????, ??? ?????? ??? ? ???? ?????? ???. ? ???? ?? ?? ????? ??? ???? ???????, ???? ???????????? ? ???.
