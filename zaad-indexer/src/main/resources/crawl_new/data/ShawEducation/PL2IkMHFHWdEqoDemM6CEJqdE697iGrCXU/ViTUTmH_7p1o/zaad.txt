Published on Jan 27, 2014
Follow Shaw English: http://bit.ly/1dTGEpiWatch 'Arba' and 'arbeit' are konglish terms that make me crazy! I try so hard to teach my students the correct expressions, but they never change. I hope you learn from this video and improve your English conversation. Konglish is confusing!
