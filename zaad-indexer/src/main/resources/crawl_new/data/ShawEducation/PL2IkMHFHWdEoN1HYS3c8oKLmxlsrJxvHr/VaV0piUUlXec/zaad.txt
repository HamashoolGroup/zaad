English Pronunciation: Silent 'e'
Published on Jan 27, 2014
Follow Shaw English: http://bit.ly/1dTGEpiWatch Bill teaches the silent 'e' in English. This is a very important video to understand how the letter 'e' at the end of a word is often silent and changes the vowel sound of the word. Repeat after Bill to make your pronunciation better. For example: bat -- bate. The two words have different sounds all because a silent 'e' is added to the end of a word.
