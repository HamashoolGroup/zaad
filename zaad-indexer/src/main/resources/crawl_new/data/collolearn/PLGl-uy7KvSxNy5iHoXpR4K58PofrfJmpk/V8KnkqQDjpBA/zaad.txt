Jason R. Levine's workshop in Hammamet, Tunisia (April 22nd, 2012)
Published on Apr 24, 2012
This is one of the best workshops I have ever attended. Jason is an amazing teacher. I wrote the poem below as a tribute to his outstanding efforts to make learning enjoyable: Here's Jason R Levine We can simply call him Jase Who is indentified with the catchphrase, Fluency MC, that has the power to amaze The audience that is not allowed to laze Jase is here to turn everything ablaze Even boredom will change into a charming craze Relax, sing, and rap with the music he plays To remember things in simple ways ?
