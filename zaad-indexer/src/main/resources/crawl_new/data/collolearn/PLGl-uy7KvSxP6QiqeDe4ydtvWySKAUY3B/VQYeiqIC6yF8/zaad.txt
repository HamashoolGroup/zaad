Online Session: Jason R Levine Hassan Hassan
Published on Mar 28, 2015
Online Session with Jason R. Levine. This took place in AlNour High School, Araara Negev, Israel. Jason is a great English teacher and I had great time being his student in the past. One of his famous approaches for teaching English is called Fluency MC, in which he uses music to teach certain topics. He states: "The best way to build a base of knowledge in a foreign language is to follow the 3Rs: Relax, Repeat, Remember. When activities are engaging and provide multiple exposures to target language, we're more likely to remember language with accuracy and use it with fluency. We can then build upon this base to achieve our communicative goals." Follow Jason on Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/FluencyMC/in... and on WIZIQ https://www.wiziq.com/fluencymc
