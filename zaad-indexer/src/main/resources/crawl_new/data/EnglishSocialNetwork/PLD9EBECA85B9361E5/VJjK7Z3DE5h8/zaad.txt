Their meanings are similar, but there are differences. I hope that this video will help you to see how we use "do" as a main verb, rather than as an auxiliary verb, for activities that produce no physical object, for general ideas, and in many common expressions. I hope, also, that it will show you how the verb "make", which is only ever used as a main verb and never as an auxiliary verb, is used when we create something that you can touch and with many common expressions. If you are serious about improving your English, then perfecting your accent should be an important part of the process.
