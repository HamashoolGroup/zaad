Fox News Sunday with transcript, July 5 2015 Part 3 - about same-sex marriage
Published on Jul 26, 2015
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: All of us welcome today's news should be mindful of that fact. Recognize different viewpoints. Revere our deep commitment to religious freedom. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: That was President Obama reacting to the Supreme Court's ruling declaring same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. What does it mean now for people of faith? Can same-sex marriage and religious liberty co-exist? Here on that debate, Kelly Shackelford, president and CEO of Liberty Institute, and in New York, Evan Wolfson, president and founder of Freedom to Marry. Gentlemen, welcome to Fox News Sunday. EVAN WOLFSON, PRES., FREEDOM TO MARRY: Glad to be with you. KELLY SHACKELFORD, PRES., CEO, LIBERTY INST.: Glad to be with you. BREAM: I also want to start by reading a part of Justice Kennedy's opinion. He authored the majority opinion here. He said, it must be emphasized that religions and those who adhere to religious doctrines may continue to activate with utmost sincere conviction that by divine precept, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. Kelly, he went on to talk about First Amendment protection. You have got the president talking about it. You have got the justice who wrote the opinion guaranteeing that you have protection. So why are you sounding an alarm? SHACKELFORD: I think that I'm sounding an alarm a little bit because you have people that want to use this decision in an improper way. I think what you said is very important. You read from the majority opinion there. The decision was 5-4 on marriage. The decision was 9-0 on religious freedom and free speech under the First Amendment not being curtailed as a result of this decision, specifically saying that those who advocate on the opposite side of marriage, those who disagree with same-sex marriage, have the full protection of the First Amendment, and you can't use this decision as some sort of license to discriminate or to persecute those who believe the other way. BREAM: Evan, it's clear that a number of dissenting justices, in fact all of them, did have those concerns. I want to read part of what Justice Alito wrote in his dissent. He said, "This decision will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodox." He went on to add, "I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat their views in public, they'll risk being labeled as bigots, and treated as such by governments, employers and schools." Evan, did he overstate it? WOLFSON: Yes, he did. And Mr. Shackelford, surprisingly, I agree with when he's talked about the fact that the Constitution does protect freedom of speech, including for those who disagree with treating gay people equally and the freedom to marry that the court has respected. Look, we all believe in religious freedom. We all believe in free speech, or at least we should, and the Constitution certainly protects it. There is no conflict here. People have the absolute right to preach and to think and to say whatever they believe, and at the same time those beliefs can't be used as the basis for denying other people their equal rights and their equal freedom. BREAM: And we're seeing these two interests on a collision course this week on a case out of Oregon. A Christian couple owned a bakery there. They declined to do a same-sex wedding cake for a female couple. It was at a time in Oregon where same-sex marriage was not yet legal, but they have since been ordered this week to pay $135,000 fine, and also they've been said they cannot talk about their beliefs in the context of this case. Evan, regardless of how you feel about the underlying merits of the case, do you have any concerns as an American about what essentially turns into a gag order now for this couple?
