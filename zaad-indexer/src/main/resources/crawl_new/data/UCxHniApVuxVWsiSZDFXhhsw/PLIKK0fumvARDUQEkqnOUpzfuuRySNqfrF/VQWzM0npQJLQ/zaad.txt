(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: We have a lot of work to do. We have some tough issues. But there's a genuine effort by everybody to be serious about this and to understand the time constraints that we're working under. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Secretary of State John Kerry striking a cautiously optimistic tone as he and world partners work toward the latest Iran nuclear deal deadline. We're back now with the panel. Juan, it seems that they are inching closer. We're getting updates that seem that the talks are continuing, they are hammering out we understand at least some ideas about sanctions, which leaders there, Iranian leaders have said they all need to go or there is no deal. WILLIAMS: I think it's sanctions and inspections, that comes down to sort of the nitty-gritty, the final steps here. But it does appear that they are in intense, head-to-head conversations that would lead you to conclude that something is coming. BREAM: We want to also play a little bit of what we're hearing from Iran's foreign minister. This is what he says about why world powers are now even at the table with Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Now they realize that the most indiscriminate and unjust economic sanctions against my country have achieved absolutely none of their declared objectives, but instead have harmed innocents and antagonized a peaceful and forgiving nation. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Jackie, obviously, officials on our side say it is the sanctions that got them to the table. KUCINICH: Right, well, this is about letting everyone to save face so they can walk back to their respective countries and say, look, we got something that's good. Iran gets to say, look, they lifted the sanctions right away. The West gets to say, look, we are going to lift sanctions, but these are under a certain number of conditions that they have to make, or this is not going happen. That's what it's about.
