Fox News Sunday with transcript, July 12 2015 Part 1 - Iran nuclear negotiations
Published on Jul 31, 2015
The U.S. and other world powers are working with a new goal of Monday to reach an agreement in the Iran nuclear negotiations. It's the fourth extension in the marathon talks and now we have word from Vienna a deal could be within reach. Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke has the latest -- Kevin. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, the U.S., Iran and those five world powers have given themselves until Monday to reach that deal but there's reporting as you point out to suggest overnight that a deal could be imminent and announced perhaps as soon as tomorrow. Secretary of State John Kerry and his team have gone to great lengths to reach a deal despite Iran?s repeated violations of U.N. sanctions and general destabilizing behavior in the Middle East. Now, this final push comes amid accusations from Tehran that the West is trying to change the terms of the deal at the 11th hour. And, yes, there are still several major sticking points. Among them, Iran would like immediate relief from the U.N. arms embargo that dates back to 2006. It?d also like to limit access to their military sites during possible inspections and perhaps most importantly, they would like to speed up sanctions relief because of the beleaguered economy there. Now, despite all of the road blocks, Secretary Kerry remains optimistic.
