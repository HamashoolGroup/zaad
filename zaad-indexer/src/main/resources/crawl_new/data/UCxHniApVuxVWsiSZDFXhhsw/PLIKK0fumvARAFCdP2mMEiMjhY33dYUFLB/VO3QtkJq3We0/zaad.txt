VOA DAILY WORLD NEWS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS July 13, 2015 From Washington, this is VOA news. I'm David Forrest reporting. More work on an agreement with Iran. Another meeting-packed day for nuclear negotiators in Vienna has pushed the Iran talks to the final hours ahead of a July 13 deadline. With no announcements made, U.S. and European diplomats worked through dinner late Sunday in an effort to resolve major outstanding issues. Meanwhile, on the TV program Fox News Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the deal may face skepticism in the U.S. Congress. "The administration chose to go down this path, and we're going to be interested in things like will the Iranians reveal their past research and development? What have they done in the past on this subject? Is it verifiable? Will we be able to look at all of their military bases?" :Senator Mitch McConnell. Eurozone leaders met Sunday in Brussels for talks on finding a solution to the Greek financial crisis. Lisa Bryant takes a look. With just hours to reach some sort of an agreement on the fate of Greece, leaders of the 19-member euro currency union framed the talks in dramatic terms. Heading into the Brussels summit, European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker said he would "fight until the last millisecond" to reach a deal that keeps Greece in the eurozone. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Athens is ready for what he called "an honest compromise." Lisa Bryant, Paris. The United States says it strongly condemns the recent al-Shabaab attacks on the Somali capital, Mogadishu. At least 16 people were killed in attacks on two hotels on Friday.

Mexico's notorious drug kingpin, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has escaped from a maximum-security prison. It's his second escape in 14 years. A security official said Guzman, who headed the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was last seen late Saturday in the shower area of the Altiplano prison. He said Guzman escaped through a hole found underneath the shower. That hole connected to an elaborate 1.5-kilometer long tunnel that led to a local town. The official also said 18 prison workers are being held for questioning. Burundi is postponing its presidential election for nearly a week.

They are demanding the government approve a higher minimum wage. The workers marched outside an industrial zone in the country's largest city of Yangon.
