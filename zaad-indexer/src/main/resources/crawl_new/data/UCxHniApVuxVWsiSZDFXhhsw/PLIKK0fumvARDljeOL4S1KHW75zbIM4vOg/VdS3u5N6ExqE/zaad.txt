Nkurunziza Set to Win Third Term as Burundi?s President Burundi held a presidential election Tuesday. Current leader Pierre Nkurunziza was the only candidate. He is seeking a third term in office. Most voting stations opened in the early morning. Voter turnout was low in areas that have seen violent protests in recent weeks. In the Bujumbura neighborhood, Cibitoke, only 15 of 400 registered voters had voted by midday. Electoral officials told VOA there was some gunfire at the Cibitoke voting station a few hours after it opened. Anti-government protesters and the international community have been calling for President Nkurunziza to resign for months. Critics said he should not be permitted to serve another term, as the law permits only two. But Burundi's highest court ruled that the president could serve again because he was appointed, not elected, to his first term.
