Published on Jan 20, 2016
Helen's not happy about a decision that's been made and Rob tries to offer some sympathy with a strange idiom that involves swallowing something that doesn't taste very nice. Find out what he means in the programme. Transcript Feifei Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob. Rob Hi everyone? errr, Feifei are you OK? You don't sound as cheerful as normal. Feifei I feel terrible today ? I've got a headache, feel really tired? I think I'm developing flu. I'm going to take these paracetamol tablets. Rob Hold on Feifei. Are you sure you're getting flu? This hasn't got anything to do with that job promotion you didn't get? Feifei Of course not? well maybe a little. Rob Hmm, I know you wanted that promotion so much but Daisy got it instead didn't she? Feifei Exactly ? and I've been working here much longer than her and I have loads more experience. It's so unfair! Rob I know? it's a bitter pill to swallow. Feifei Thanks for the advice but even if these tablets ? or pills - are bitter, they'll make me feel better ? now can you show me some more sympathy about my promotion please? Rob I was Feifei! When I said 'it's a bitter pill to swallow' I really meant it's a situation that is unpleasant and difficult to accept. Feifei OK, I see! You're saying I'm finding Daisy's promotion hard to accept? Rob It's tough Feifei but that's the way things are. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action? Examples When John found out about his wife's affair with his best friend, it was a bitter pill to swallow. It was a bitter pill to swallow knowing that my older sister finished the race quicker than me. My friend has booked the same flights as me for half the price ? it's a bitter pill to swallow! Feifei So 'a bitter pill to swallow' means I don't like what's happened but I will have to accept it? Hmm, I like the phrase but it doesn't make me feel any better. Rob You'll just have to swallow the decision Feifei! Daisy is going to be your boss now. Feifei Oh dear? I think my flu might be getting worse now? I'm definitely going to take these paracetamol now? Yuk, that really was bitter! Rob I think two tablets are enough for now Feifei. Maybe you should take tomorrow off work. Feifei What a great idea Rob. See you later. Rob Bye!
