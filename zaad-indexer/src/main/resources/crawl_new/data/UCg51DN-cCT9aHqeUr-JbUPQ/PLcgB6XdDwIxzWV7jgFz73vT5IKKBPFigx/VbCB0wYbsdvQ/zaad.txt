Published on Jan 25, 2016
Neil's made a great saving by going to a car boot sale and stocking up on all his kids' presents for next year! Let's hope they don't find out! He also picked up an old coin which looked almost new but did he get a bargain? Listen out for the phrase he uses to mean it's in good condition. Transcript Helen Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil. Neil Hello everyone. Helen So Neil, where did you go last weekend? Neil I went to a car boot sale near my home. There were lots of sellers getting rid of unwanted Christmas presents. Helen So did you manage to pick up any bargains? Neil Plenty, I got presents for my kids to last the rest of the year. And I picked up this little gem. Look! Helen What is it? Neil It?s an old silver English coin. Helen Is it real? It looks quite new to me. Neil It does, doesn?t it? I had a close look and it?s in good nick. Helen Good Nick? Who's Nick? Neil Oh, I don?t mean Nick as a person?s name. When British people say ?it?s in good nick?, we mean ?it?s in good condition?, especially if it?s something that?s very old but still looks new. Here are a few examples: Examples I picked up a set of silver plates from an antique shop and they were in pretty good nick. My grandpa loves his 1960s motorbike and has worked very hard to kept it in good nick. Neil I know it sounds a bit strange to use a word that?s like a person?s name in this phrase, but it?s very authentic colloquial British English. ?Nick? here is slang for ?condition?. Helen I see. Can we use the phrase to describe anything else in good condition? Neil Absolutely, how about my grandmother, she?s 96 and still does her own shopping, she?s in good nick. Helen That?s impressive. I hope I'll be in good nick when I get to her age. Neil Keep fit and eat well! Both Bye.
