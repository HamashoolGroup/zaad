Differentiating between the P & B sounds - English Accent Lesson to improve pronunciation Blog : http://www.learnex.in/differentiating... In English, there are many consonants which have similar jaw/mouth movements, but sound differently. The difference between them, usually, is the vibration felt in throat and the amount of air that comes out of one?s lips. They are called voiced and unvoiced consonants. In this lesson we will be discussing two such consonants: the B and P Website : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast The jaw movement is the same in P and B, what changes is the lip movement and the role of vocal chords. B is the Voiced Consonant. It does not involve complex lip movement, but a sensation of vibration in your vocal chords. Also, there is no air, while pronouncing the letter. If you touch you throat gently while pronouncing B, you can feel the vibration. However, P in unvoiced, there should be no vibration but a lot of air from your lips. Let?s look at few words with the B and P sound. B P Bat Pat Bee Pea Bin Pin Born (B ? ohn) Porn/Pawn (P- ohn) Bush Push Abort ( Ab- oht) Apart (Ap-aat) Cubicle (Q-bi-cal) Couple (Kuh-puhl) Fumble (Fuhm-buhl) Flapper Habit Happy (ha-pee) Zebra Zipper Cup Cub Dab Dip Lab Lap Mob Mop Tab Tap When we speak English, we have to be careful not to interchange and mix the B and P sound as change in the sound can change meaning. For eg. Simple means plain, where as , symbol means signs.
