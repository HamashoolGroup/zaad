It is commonly used in Britain. So if you want to say ?there you go? or ?finally your project is ready? you can use the idiom ?Bob is your uncle?. 4. Van Gogh: Now, Van Gogh was a deaf artist. So if someone uses this idiom for you, do not get happy. They are actually being very sarcastic. SO, if someone tells you, ?You?ve got Van Gogh?s ear for music?, do not take it as a compliment. They mean that you have a poor taste for music. 5. Pardon my French: When you use swear words and make an apology, this idiom is an informal way of doing so. So when you listen to dialogues in English, you hear a ?beep? sound that indicates that it is a swear word. So you can always follow a swear word by saying ?Please pardon my French.?
