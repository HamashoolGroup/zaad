Commonly confused words - Ago & Before - English Grammar Lesson http://www.letstalkpodcast.com Most English learners get confused while using Ago and Before, as they think these words can be used interchangeably unfortunately you can't, they mean different. In this video lesson Rachna brings out the difference between these commonly confused words and explains how to use them correctly. AGO & BEORE :- An expression with ago refers to a finished time, and is normally used with a past tense, not a present perfect tense.However, a present perfect tense is used with since ....ago(as with since+any other time expression) We have been in Bangalore since about ten years ago. Ago is used with a past tense and a time expression to count back from the present; to say how long before the present something happened. Before is used in the same way(with a past perfect tense) to count back from a past moment. I met that girl in Bangalore three years ago.( not three years before or before three years) When we got talking, I found out that I had been at school with her husband ten years before.(Not ten years ago.) We can also use "before" with a present or past perfect tense and no time expression, to mean at any before now/then. Have you seen that movie before? Have you been here before " Yes, I was here a year ago.
