Difference between 'See', 'Watch' and 'Look' - English Grammar lesson Take a test : http://learnex.in/difference-between-... Many people wrongly use these verbs as they are verbs related to vision. They can't be used interchangeably. Though they are vision related verbs, they have to be used appropriately depending on the situation. See : is a verb of perception. It is an involuntary and an effortless action. Do not use it in the continuous/progressive form 'seeing'. Example : I saw Samantha at school yesterday. (casually you noted her presence) Example : John saw a good film yesterday. (to express that an action is completed, in this case, we are talking about watching the film. 'Watch' can be used in plce of 'see' in this example) Example : Kelly saw the doctor last eveng. (here, it means she visited the doctor) Example : I will see the Marketing team tomorrow. (it means you have an appointment) Look : is used when you want to give a particular direction to your eyes. When you 'look' at something, it means you concentrate and focus on it. You see something specific at one time. Do not us the verb 'look' in its progressive/continuous form 'looking'. Example : Look! It's snowing. (so you change the direction of your eys and look towards the window) Example : Look at th sky. Watch : is used when there is a movement involved. You concentrate on something for a long time, like a movie/sport. Example : I'm watchng an English movie. Example : Watch the kittens as they may run away.(pay attention to the kittens)
