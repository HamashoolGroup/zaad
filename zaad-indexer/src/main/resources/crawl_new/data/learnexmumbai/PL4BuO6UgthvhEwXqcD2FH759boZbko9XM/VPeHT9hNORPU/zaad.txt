Using I, me, my, mine, and myself correctly ? English Grammar Lesson. Take the quiz - http://www.learnex.in/using-i-me-my-m... If you?re confused by the words I, me, my, mine, and myself, you?re not alone! In this lesson, you will learn the difference between them and when to use the right one. I and ME I is the subject ? the person who does the action in the sentence. Only use ?I? when you are referring to yourself in the subject of the sentence. In other words, you are the one taking action. I gave John the book. Me is the object ? the person who receives the action in the sentence. The pronoun ?me? should be used when someone else will perform the action to, or for, you. John gave me the book. OR: John gave the book to me. When there are more than one subject or object people do get a little confused , so we will see how to use it correctly John and I saw Jane at the party. John = subject I = subject Jane= object The teacher called Jim and me. The teacher = subject Jim = object me = object MY and MINE Use my before the word, and use mine after the word. Remember my is always followed by noun where as mine replaces the noun. John is my friend. John is a friend of mine. Those are my glasses. Those glasses are mine. MYSELF The pronoun ?myself? should only be used when you are performing the action on yourself. No one else can do anything to yourself. The word myself is used in two cases: When you do something to yourself Eg) I accidentally cut myself with the knife. For emphasis - when you want to emphasize the ?I? Eg) I baked this cake myself! BY MYSELF The expression by myself means alone: I went out to dinner by myself.
