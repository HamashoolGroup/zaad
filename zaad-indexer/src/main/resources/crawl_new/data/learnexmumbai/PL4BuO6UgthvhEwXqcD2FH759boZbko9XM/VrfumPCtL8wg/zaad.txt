English Grammar lesson - Transportation Prepositions Take the quiz : http://www.learnex.in/transportation-... In this English Grammar lesson we will learn using the prepositions related to travel / transportation. English prepositions can be tricky because they usually don't have any particular rules. However,when we talk about the ways to travel there are few rules which really work for English Learners. Website : http://www.letstalkpodcast.com Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/letstalkpodcast Youtube : http://www.youtube.com/learnexmumbai Using the preposition By :- When we talk about general ways to travel we always use the preposition 'by'. For example - We travel by car ,by train , by can, by bus, by plane and so on. We can also use the preposition 'by' to refer to the transportation environment or the surface for example, by air, by land, by sea, by rail. Using the preposition In :- When we talk about specific transport vehicles we use the preposition 'in'. If you can sit inside the vehicle we use 'in'. For example - In a car , In a truck , in a helicopter , in a taxi, in a rowboat. Using the preposition on :- When we talk about specific transport vehicles especially on which one can stand or walk on a vehicle, we use the preposition 'on'. For example - We go on a plane , we go on a ferry , we go on a ship , on a Train , on a Bicycle, on a Motorbike , ( the basic mode of travel - on foot). Also when we talk about sitting on animals we always use the preposition on or onto, for example - We get on / onto a horse, camel, elephant etc. The key thing is to understand when something is general and when something is specific . Hope this English Grammar lesson is clear to all you out there.
