American Accent Training - ACCENT REDUCTION You supposedly have an non native, an accent that is normally excepted of most non native speakers. You may have a good knowledge of the English language but that does not guarantee a good accent. But what does a "good accent" mean? It means an accent that is easy on all ears across the globe. An accent that is understood by all in the international community, no matter who the listener is -- an American or a British or an Australian or a Canadian or people from any country. This accent is called neutral accent. Do not assume that all native English speaking people speak with the same accent. They differ. And people who are not native English speakers -- an Indian or a Chinese or a Korean -- have their own typical accent patterns. Both of them -- native English speakers and non-native English speakers -- need to undergo the accent reduction process in order to acquire the neutral accent.
