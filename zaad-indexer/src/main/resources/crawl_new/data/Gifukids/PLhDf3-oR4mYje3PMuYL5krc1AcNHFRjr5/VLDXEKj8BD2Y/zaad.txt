Artist: http://incompetech.com/ Hello Everyone! This video is designed for students, teachers and anyone wanting to learn English. My videos are vocabulary-based for conversation practice. Each video is themed to provide context for learning. To insure success, every video is designed with open slots for vocabulary substitution practice. These patterns allow students to practice on their own and teachers can have their class practice together as a group. These videos also work great for icebreakers and class discussions. Please have fun and speak English now! Thank you for your kind support :) Mark Kulek Here are my eBooks: 25 Short Simple Conversations Volume One: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MT6OZ54 25 Short Simple Conversations Volume Two: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014MN7ESQ For those of you who are interested in teaching English to young learners.
