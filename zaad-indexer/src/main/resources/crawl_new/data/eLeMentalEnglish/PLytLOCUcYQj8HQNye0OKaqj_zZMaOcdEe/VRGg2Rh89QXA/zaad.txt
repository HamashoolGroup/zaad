Published on Jun 10, 2014
Listen to Larissa answer the question, "Do you teach in person in a classroom?" while practicing your English listening skills (WITH SUBTITLES). (PART 2 | NO SUBTITLES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOoQC...) TRANSCRIPT: http://www.elementalenglish.com/quest... INSTRUCTIONS: Listen to what I say while reading the text. Notice how I change the language: -What do I stress? -What do I de-stress? -Where does my voice (pitch) go up? -What words and sounds am I connecting? -What words and sounds am I creating from those connections? -What sounds and words am I deleting? Do this several times, then watch the same video without subtitles. Do you understand more? Do this repeatedly. Remember to be an ACTIVE listener!
