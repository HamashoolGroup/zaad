Intonation: Making lists in English | Part 7 | English Pronunciation Lesson
Published on Feb 9, 2014
Practice using your voice to making lists or to express a series of options in English. Note: my voice is a touch dramatic in some of the rises, so that you can hear it clearly. How much speakers' pitch rises and falls depends on the individual speaker (gender, personality sexual orientation, region, emotion, etc...).
